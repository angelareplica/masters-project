       ", Washington, D.C., December 27, 2012,  — The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that, on December 26, 2012, the Honorable Jed S. Rakoff, United States District Judge, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, entered a Final Judgment, on consent, as to former hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam in the SEC’s insider trading case, , SEC v. Rajat K. Gupta and Raj Rajaratnam,,  Civil Action No. 11-CV-7566 (SDNY) (JSR).  The final judgment orders Rajaratnam to pay $1,299,120 in disgorgement and $147,738, in prejudgment interest, for a total of $1,446,858.  , \n",
       ", The SEC’s complaint, filed October 26, 2011, alleges that, among other things, Rajat K. Gupta tipped his business associate Raj Rajaratnam, Galleon Management’s founder and managing general partner, to confidential information Gupta learned in the course of his duties as a member of the Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.  The complaint alleges that Gupta disclosed material nonpublic information concerning Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs in September 2008, and concerning Goldman Sachs’s financial results for both the second and the fourth quarter of 2008.  Rajaratnam used the information he learned from Gupta to trade profitably in certain Galleon hedge funds.  By engaging in this conduct, Gupta and Rajaratnam violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  , \n",
       ", On June 15, 2012, in a parallel criminal case arising out of the same facts, Gupta was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and three counts of securities fraud.  On October 24, 2012, Gupta was sentenced to two years in prison and one year of supervised release, and ordered to pay a $5 million criminal fine.  , \n",
       ", The Final Judgment in the SEC’s case orders Rajaratnam to disgorge his share of the profits gained and losses avoided as a result of the insider trading plus prejudgment interest on that amount.  The SEC’s claims against Gupta remain pending., \n",

       ", On December 26, 2012 the Securities and Exchange Commission announced additional charges in an insider trading case against two brokers who traded on nonpublic information ahead of IBM Corporation’s acquisition of SPSS Inc.  , \n",
       ", In an amended complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC is now charging research analyst Trent Martin, who was the brokers’ source of confidential information in an insider trading scheme that yielded more than $1 million in illicit profits.  Martin worked at a brokerage firm in Connecticut and specialized in Australian equity investments, and he learned nonpublic information about the impending IBM-SPSS transaction from an attorney friend who was working on the deal.  Rather than maintaining the confidence of the information, Martin used the information for his own benefit, purchasing SPSS securities and subsequently tipping his roommate Thomas C. Conradt, who traded and tipped his friend and fellow retail broker David J. Weishaus.  Martin was specifically named as their source in instant messages between Conradt and Weishaus about their illegal trading., \n",
       ", The SEC charged Conradt and Weishaus with insider trading on November 29.  Martin, who fled the U.S. to Australia soon after learning about the SEC’s investigation, currently lives in Hong Kong. , \n",
       ", “Martin is a licensed professional who knowingly disregarded insider trading laws to enrich himself, and then fled the United States when he learned of our investigation,” said Daniel M. Hawke, Director of the SEC’s Philadelphia Regional Office.  “Martin could run but he could not hide, as the long arm of the SEC will extend to those who flee the United States hoping to avoid the consequences of their unlawful conduct.”, \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that Martin’s attorney friend expected him to maintain information in confidence and refrain from illegal trading or disclosing it to others.  The attorney sought moral support, reassurance, and advice when he privately told Martin about his new assignment working on the IBM-SPSS acquisition.  The lawyer disclosed to Martin such details as the anticipated transaction price and the identities of the acquiring and target companies while he was describing the magnitude of the assignment. , \n",
       ", According to the SEC’s complaint, Martin attempted to purchase SPSS common stock on the very first business day after learning the nonpublic information from his friend.  His first three orders were cancelled because he did not have sufficient funds in the account to make the purchases, but he later wired $50,000 from his checking account into his brokerage account to purchase SPSS shares., \n",
       ", The SEC’s complaint alleges that Martin, Conradt and Weishaus violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The SEC is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and financial penalties, and a permanent injunction against the brokers., \n",
       ", The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority (ORSA), the New Zealand Securities Commission, and the Australia Securities and Investments Commission.  The SEC has coordinated its action with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, and also appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation., \n",

       ", SEC FILES CHARGES AGAINST TWO OTHERS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FUND MANAGER'S $60 MILLION SCHEME, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", On December 21, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed additional charges in its case against a Northern California fund manager accused of running a $60 million Ponzi-like scheme., \n",
       ", The SEC , previously charged the fund manager, , John A. Geringer, with defrauding investors by touting imaginary trading profits instead of reporting the actual trading losses he had incurred.  The agency today sought court approval to add charges against Christopher A. Luck, of Scotts Valley, Calif., and Keith E. Rode, of Franklin, Wisc., who along with Geringer were principals of GLR Capital Management LLC, which managed the GLR Growth Fund, L.P., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that GLR Capital deceived investors into thinking that the fund was earning double-digit returns by investing 75 percent of its assets in highly liquid investments tied to well-known stock indices like the S&amp;P; 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones.  In reality, the fund was heavily invested in two private, illiquid startup companies, and Geringer's trading for years had generated substantial losses.  Luck and Rode sat on the boards of directors at both startup companies., \n",
       ", \"Luck and Rode knew Geringer had squandered millions of dollars in investor funds and were uniquely positioned to stop the fraud in its tracks,\" said Marc Fagel, Director of the SEC's San Francisco Regional Office.  \"Rather than expose Geringer, they instead chose to join forces and pretend it was business as usual, further concealing the fraud from investors.\", \n",
       ", According to the SEC's amended complaint filed in federal court in San Jose and subject to court approval, Geringer in April 2009 confessed to Luck and Rode that he had been lying to them about the balances in the fund's trading accounts.  This alerted Luck and Rode to the fact that contrary to what Geringer had been telling investors, the fund had not been achieving returns of more than 17 percent by investing 75 percent of investor money in the stock market.  Instead, the lion's share of investor funds was invested in two private startup technology companies., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that, despite Geringer's confession, Luck continued to solicit new investors for the fund by touting Geringer's trading ability and providing investors with fraudulent marketing materials claiming that the fund had earned between 17 and 25 percent annual returns in every year of the fund's operation through investments tied to major stock indices.  Rode, a certified public accountant, continued to mail account statements to investors that contained grossly inflated cash balances that deceived investors about the fund's liquidity.  Several investors made additional investments in the fund and rolled over their investments for additional one-year periods after receiving these fraudulent account statements., \n",
       ", The SEC further alleges that Rode provided investors with account statements that falsely claimed \"MEMBER NASD AND SEC APPROVED.\"  The SEC does not \"approve\" funds or investments in funds, nor was the fund (or any related entity) a member of the NASD (now called the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority - FINRA)., \n",
       ", In addition to the allegations in the original complaint against Geringer and the related entities, the SEC's amended complaint alleges Luck and Rode violated or aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The amended complaint also alleges Rode violated Section 26 of the Exchange Act, which prohibits persons from claiming the SEC has passed on the merits of a security.  Additionally, the SEC seeks financial penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, permanent injunctions, and other relief from both Luck and Rode., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Robert J. Durham and Erin E. Schneider of the San Francisco Regional Office.  The SEC's litigation is being led by Sheila O'Callaghan of the San Francisco office., \n",
       ", Separately today, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California announced that a federal grand jury in San Jose indicted Geringer, Luck, and Rode in connection with their operation of the fund.  The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorney's Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and FINRA for their assistance in this matter., \n",

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged four securities industry professionals with conducting a fraudulent penny stock scheme in which they illegally acquired over a billion unregistered shares in microcap companies at deep discounts and then dumped them on the market while claiming bogus exemptions from the registration provisions of the federal securities laws., \n",
       ", The SEC Complaint alleges that, from at least early 2007 until 2010, Danny Garber, Michael Manis, Kenneth Yellin, and Jordan Feinstein acquired shares at about 30 to 60 percent off the market price by misrepresenting to the penny stock companies that they intended to hold the shares for investment purposes rather than immediately re-selling them.  Instead, they immediately sold the shares without registering them by purporting to rely on an exemption for transactions that are in compliance with certain types of state law exemptions.  However, no such state law exemptions were applicable to their transactions.  To create the appearance that the claimed exemptions were valid, they created virtual corporate presences in Minnesota, Texas, and Delaware.  The SEC also charged 12 entities that they operated in connection with the scheme., \n",
       ", The SEC's action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations by Garber, Manis, Yellin, Feinstein and the named entities of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The SEC's complaint seeks a final judgment, among other things, ordering all of the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and financial penalties; permanently enjoining all the defendants from future violations of the securities laws; and permanently enjoining all the defendants from participating in penny stock offerings., \n",

       ", SEC Charges Former Chairman of Board In Connection With A Fraudulent Plan To Evade The Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today it filed a civil action against Lee S. Rosen, the former Chairman of the Board of publicly traded New Generation Biofuels Holdings, Inc., alleging that he fraudulently evaded the reporting requirements concerning his ownership interest in New Generation shares held in five separate trusts in violation of the antifraud provisions and beneficial reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the Commission's complaint, at various times from June 2007 through May 2010, Rosen, directly or indirectly profited from the sale of New Generation shares held in two of the five trusts and benefited from using shares in two trusts as payment toward an ultimately unsuccessful purchase of a yacht.  The complaint alleges that Rosen received at least $666,000 in direct payments from sales of New Generation stock held in three of the trusts and from a trustee's individual brokerage account.  The complaint also alleges that Rosen indirectly benefited from using New Generation shares held in two trusts as partial payment in an effort to purchase a yacht.  Further, the complaint alleges that Rosen failed to disclose these transactions and his true holdings in New Generation securities in various Commission filings and that Rosen made false and misleading statements and omissions in Commission filings regarding his true beneficial ownership of New Generation shares., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges Rosen with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b), 13(d) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1, 13d-2, 16a-3, and 16a-8 thereunder.  Rosen has agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations.  Rosen consented to a permanent injunction, and an order requiring him to pay $666,000 in disgorgement, plus $50,484 in prejudgment interest, a $195,000 civil money penalty, and barring him from serving as an officer or director., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Miami Regional Office by Senior Counsel Jorge L. Riera and Accountant Karaz S. Zaki under the supervision of Assistant Regional Director Elisha L. Frank.  Christine Nestor will lead the SEC's litigation., \n",

       ", SEC Obtains Final Judgment on Consent as to Raj Rajaratnam, \n",
       ", Washington, D.C., December 27, 2012,  — The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that, on December 26, 2012, the Honorable Jed S. Rakoff, United States District Judge, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, entered a Final Judgment, on consent, as to former hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam in the SEC’s insider trading case, , SEC v. Rajat K. Gupta and Raj Rajaratnam,,  Civil Action No. 11-CV-7566 (SDNY) (JSR).  The final judgment orders Rajaratnam to pay $1,299,120 in disgorgement and $147,738, in prejudgment interest, for a total of $1,446,858.  , \n",
       ", The SEC’s complaint, filed October 26, 2011, alleges that, among other things, Rajat K. Gupta tipped his business associate Raj Rajaratnam, Galleon Management’s founder and managing general partner, to confidential information Gupta learned in the course of his duties as a member of the Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.  The complaint alleges that Gupta disclosed material nonpublic information concerning Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs in September 2008, and concerning Goldman Sachs’s financial results for both the second and the fourth quarter of 2008.  Rajaratnam used the information he learned from Gupta to trade profitably in certain Galleon hedge funds.  By engaging in this conduct, Gupta and Rajaratnam violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  , \n",
       ", On June 15, 2012, in a parallel criminal case arising out of the same facts, Gupta was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and three counts of securities fraud.  On October 24, 2012, Gupta was sentenced to two years in prison and one year of supervised release, and ordered to pay a $5 million criminal fine.  , \n",
       ", The Final Judgment in the SEC’s case orders Rajaratnam to disgorge his share of the profits gained and losses avoided as a result of the insider trading plus prejudgment interest on that amount.  The SEC’s claims against Gupta remain pending., \n",

       ", On December 26, 2012 the Securities and Exchange Commission announced additional charges in an insider trading case against two brokers who traded on nonpublic information ahead of IBM Corporation’s acquisition of SPSS Inc.  , \n",
       ", In an amended complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC is now charging research analyst Trent Martin, who was the brokers’ source of confidential information in an insider trading scheme that yielded more than $1 million in illicit profits.  Martin worked at a brokerage firm in Connecticut and specialized in Australian equity investments, and he learned nonpublic information about the impending IBM-SPSS transaction from an attorney friend who was working on the deal.  Rather than maintaining the confidence of the information, Martin used the information for his own benefit, purchasing SPSS securities and subsequently tipping his roommate Thomas C. Conradt, who traded and tipped his friend and fellow retail broker David J. Weishaus.  Martin was specifically named as their source in instant messages between Conradt and Weishaus about their illegal trading., \n",
       ", The SEC charged Conradt and Weishaus with insider trading on November 29.  Martin, who fled the U.S. to Australia soon after learning about the SEC’s investigation, currently lives in Hong Kong. , \n",
       ", “Martin is a licensed professional who knowingly disregarded insider trading laws to enrich himself, and then fled the United States when he learned of our investigation,” said Daniel M. Hawke, Director of the SEC’s Philadelphia Regional Office.  “Martin could run but he could not hide, as the long arm of the SEC will extend to those who flee the United States hoping to avoid the consequences of their unlawful conduct.”, \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that Martin’s attorney friend expected him to maintain information in confidence and refrain from illegal trading or disclosing it to others.  The attorney sought moral support, reassurance, and advice when he privately told Martin about his new assignment working on the IBM-SPSS acquisition.  The lawyer disclosed to Martin such details as the anticipated transaction price and the identities of the acquiring and target companies while he was describing the magnitude of the assignment. , \n",
       ", According to the SEC’s complaint, Martin attempted to purchase SPSS common stock on the very first business day after learning the nonpublic information from his friend.  His first three orders were cancelled because he did not have sufficient funds in the account to make the purchases, but he later wired $50,000 from his checking account into his brokerage account to purchase SPSS shares., \n",
       ", The SEC’s complaint alleges that Martin, Conradt and Weishaus violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The SEC is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and financial penalties, and a permanent injunction against the brokers., \n",
       ", The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority (ORSA), the New Zealand Securities Commission, and the Australia Securities and Investments Commission.  The SEC has coordinated its action with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, and also appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation., \n",

       ", SEC FILES CHARGES AGAINST TWO OTHERS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FUND MANAGER'S $60 MILLION SCHEME, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", On December 21, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed additional charges in its case against a Northern California fund manager accused of running a $60 million Ponzi-like scheme., \n",
       ", The SEC , previously charged the fund manager, , John A. Geringer, with defrauding investors by touting imaginary trading profits instead of reporting the actual trading losses he had incurred.  The agency today sought court approval to add charges against Christopher A. Luck, of Scotts Valley, Calif., and Keith E. Rode, of Franklin, Wisc., who along with Geringer were principals of GLR Capital Management LLC, which managed the GLR Growth Fund, L.P., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that GLR Capital deceived investors into thinking that the fund was earning double-digit returns by investing 75 percent of its assets in highly liquid investments tied to well-known stock indices like the S&P; 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones.  In reality, the fund was heavily invested in two private, illiquid startup companies, and Geringer's trading for years had generated substantial losses.  Luck and Rode sat on the boards of directors at both startup companies., \n",
       ", \"Luck and Rode knew Geringer had squandered millions of dollars in investor funds and were uniquely positioned to stop the fraud in its tracks,\" said Marc Fagel, Director of the SEC's San Francisco Regional Office.  \"Rather than expose Geringer, they instead chose to join forces and pretend it was business as usual, further concealing the fraud from investors.\", \n",
       ", According to the SEC's amended complaint filed in federal court in San Jose and subject to court approval, Geringer in April 2009 confessed to Luck and Rode that he had been lying to them about the balances in the fund's trading accounts.  This alerted Luck and Rode to the fact that contrary to what Geringer had been telling investors, the fund had not been achieving returns of more than 17 percent by investing 75 percent of investor money in the stock market.  Instead, the lion's share of investor funds was invested in two private startup technology companies., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that, despite Geringer's confession, Luck continued to solicit new investors for the fund by touting Geringer's trading ability and providing investors with fraudulent marketing materials claiming that the fund had earned between 17 and 25 percent annual returns in every year of the fund's operation through investments tied to major stock indices.  Rode, a certified public accountant, continued to mail account statements to investors that contained grossly inflated cash balances that deceived investors about the fund's liquidity.  Several investors made additional investments in the fund and rolled over their investments for additional one-year periods after receiving these fraudulent account statements., \n",
       ", The SEC further alleges that Rode provided investors with account statements that falsely claimed \"MEMBER NASD AND SEC APPROVED.\"  The SEC does not \"approve\" funds or investments in funds, nor was the fund (or any related entity) a member of the NASD (now called the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority - FINRA)., \n",
       ", In addition to the allegations in the original complaint against Geringer and the related entities, the SEC's amended complaint alleges Luck and Rode violated or aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The amended complaint also alleges Rode violated Section 26 of the Exchange Act, which prohibits persons from claiming the SEC has passed on the merits of a security.  Additionally, the SEC seeks financial penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, permanent injunctions, and other relief from both Luck and Rode., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Robert J. Durham and Erin E. Schneider of the San Francisco Regional Office.  The SEC's litigation is being led by Sheila O'Callaghan of the San Francisco office., \n",
       ", Separately today, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California announced that a federal grand jury in San Jose indicted Geringer, Luck, and Rode in connection with their operation of the fund.  The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorney's Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and FINRA for their assistance in this matter., \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged four securities industry professionals with conducting a fraudulent penny stock scheme in which they illegally acquired over a billion unregistered shares in microcap companies at deep discounts and then dumped them on the market while claiming bogus exemptions from the registration provisions of the federal securities laws., \n",
       ", The SEC Complaint alleges that, from at least early 2007 until 2010, Danny Garber, Michael Manis, Kenneth Yellin, and Jordan Feinstein acquired shares at about 30 to 60 percent off the market price by misrepresenting to the penny stock companies that they intended to hold the shares for investment purposes rather than immediately re-selling them.  Instead, they immediately sold the shares without registering them by purporting to rely on an exemption for transactions that are in compliance with certain types of state law exemptions.  However, no such state law exemptions were applicable to their transactions.  To create the appearance that the claimed exemptions were valid, they created virtual corporate presences in Minnesota, Texas, and Delaware.  The SEC also charged 12 entities that they operated in connection with the scheme., \n",
       ", The SEC's action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations by Garber, Manis, Yellin, Feinstein and the named entities of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The SEC's complaint seeks a final judgment, among other things, ordering all of the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and financial penalties; permanently enjoining all the defendants from future violations of the securities laws; and permanently enjoining all the defendants from participating in penny stock offerings., \n",
       ", The New York Regional Office's Michael Paley, Laura Yeu, Elzbieta Wraga, Haimavathi Marlier, Yitzchok Klug and Paul Gizzi conducted the investigation., \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today it filed a civil action against Lee S. Rosen, the former Chairman of the Board of publicly traded New Generation Biofuels Holdings, Inc., alleging that he fraudulently evaded the reporting requirements concerning his ownership interest in New Generation shares held in five separate trusts in violation of the antifraud provisions and beneficial reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the Commission's complaint, at various times from June 2007 through May 2010, Rosen, directly or indirectly profited from the sale of New Generation shares held in two of the five trusts and benefited from using shares in two trusts as payment toward an ultimately unsuccessful purchase of a yacht.  The complaint alleges that Rosen received at least $666,000 in direct payments from sales of New Generation stock held in three of the trusts and from a trustee's individual brokerage account.  The complaint also alleges that Rosen indirectly benefited from using New Generation shares held in two trusts as partial payment in an effort to purchase a yacht.  Further, the complaint alleges that Rosen failed to disclose these transactions and his true holdings in New Generation securities in various Commission filings and that Rosen made false and misleading statements and omissions in Commission filings regarding his true beneficial ownership of New Generation shares., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges Rosen with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b), 13(d) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1, 13d-2, 16a-3, and 16a-8 thereunder.  Rosen has agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations.  Rosen consented to a permanent injunction, and an order requiring him to pay $666,000 in disgorgement, plus $50,484 in prejudgment interest, a $195,000 civil money penalty, and barring him from serving as an officer or director., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Miami Regional Office by Senior Counsel Jorge L. Riera and Accountant Karaz S. Zaki under the supervision of Assistant Regional Director Elisha L. Frank.  Christine Nestor will lead the SEC's litigation., \n",

The complaint alleges that Gupta disclosed material nonpublic information concerning Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs in September 2008, and concerning Goldman Sachs’s financial results for both the second and the fourth quarter of 2008.  Rajaratnam used the information he learned from Gupta to trade profitably in certain Galleon hedge funds.  By engaging in this conduct, Gupta and Rajaratnam violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  , \n",
       ", On June 15, 2012, in a parallel criminal case arising out of the same facts, Gupta was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and three counts of securities fraud.  On October 24, 2012, Gupta was sentenced to two years in prison and one year of supervised release, and ordered to pay a $5 million criminal fine.  , \n",
       ", The Final Judgment in the SEC’s case orders Rajaratnam to disgorge his share of the profits gained and losses avoided as a result of the insider trading plus prejudgment interest on that amount.  The SEC’s claims against Gupta remain pending., \n",

       ", On December 26, 2012 the Securities and Exchange Commission announced additional charges in an insider trading case against two brokers who traded on nonpublic information ahead of IBM Corporation’s acquisition of SPSS Inc.  , \n",
       ", In an amended complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC is now charging research analyst Trent Martin, who was the brokers’ source of confidential information in an insider trading scheme that yielded more than $1 million in illicit profits.  Martin worked at a brokerage firm in Connecticut and specialized in Australian equity investments, and he learned nonpublic information about the impending IBM-SPSS transaction from an attorney friend who was working on the deal.  Rather than maintaining the confidence of the information, Martin used the information for his own benefit, purchasing SPSS securities and subsequently tipping his roommate Thomas C. Conradt, who traded and tipped his friend and fellow retail broker David J. Weishaus.  Martin was specifically named as their source in instant messages between Conradt and Weishaus about their illegal trading., \n",
       ", The SEC charged Conradt and Weishaus with insider trading on November 29.  Martin, who fled the U.S. to Australia soon after learning about the SEC’s investigation, currently lives in Hong Kong. , \n",
       ", “Martin is a licensed professional who knowingly disregarded insider trading laws to enrich himself, and then fled the United States when he learned of our investigation,” said Daniel M. Hawke, Director of the SEC’s Philadelphia Regional Office.  “Martin could run but he could not hide, as the long arm of the SEC will extend to those who flee the United States hoping to avoid the consequences of their unlawful conduct.”, \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that Martin’s attorney friend expected him to maintain information in confidence and refrain from illegal trading or disclosing it to others.  The attorney sought moral support, reassurance, and advice when he privately told Martin about his new assignment working on the IBM-SPSS acquisition.  The lawyer disclosed to Martin such details as the anticipated transaction price and the identities of the acquiring and target companies while he was describing the magnitude of the assignment. , \n",
       ", According to the SEC’s complaint, Martin attempted to purchase SPSS common stock on the very first business day after learning the nonpublic information from his friend.  His first three orders were cancelled because he did not have sufficient funds in the account to make the purchases, but he later wired $50,000 from his checking account into his brokerage account to purchase SPSS shares., \n",
       ", The SEC’s complaint alleges that Martin, Conradt and Weishaus violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The SEC is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and financial penalties, and a permanent injunction against the brokers., \n",
       ", The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority (ORSA), the New Zealand Securities Commission, and the Australia Securities and Investments Commission.  The SEC has coordinated its action with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, and also appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation., \n",

       ", SEC FILES CHARGES AGAINST TWO OTHERS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FUND MANAGER'S $60 MILLION SCHEME, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", On December 21, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed additional charges in its case against a Northern California fund manager accused of running a $60 million Ponzi-like scheme., \n",
       ", The SEC , previously charged the fund manager, , John A. Geringer, with defrauding investors by touting imaginary trading profits instead of reporting the actual trading losses he had incurred.  The agency today sought court approval to add charges against Christopher A. Luck, of Scotts Valley, Calif., and Keith E. Rode, of Franklin, Wisc., who along with Geringer were principals of GLR Capital Management LLC, which managed the GLR Growth Fund, L.P., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that GLR Capital deceived investors into thinking that the fund was earning double-digit returns by investing 75 percent of its assets in highly liquid investments tied to well-known stock indices like the S&amp;P; 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones.  In reality, the fund was heavily invested in two private, illiquid startup companies, and Geringer's trading for years had generated substantial losses.  Luck and Rode sat on the boards of directors at both startup companies., \n",
       ", \"Luck and Rode knew Geringer had squandered millions of dollars in investor funds and were uniquely positioned to stop the fraud in its tracks,\" said Marc Fagel, Director of the SEC's San Francisco Regional Office.  \"Rather than expose Geringer, they instead chose to join forces and pretend it was business as usual, further concealing the fraud from investors.\", \n",
       ", According to the SEC's amended complaint filed in federal court in San Jose and subject to court approval, Geringer in April 2009 confessed to Luck and Rode that he had been lying to them about the balances in the fund's trading accounts.  This alerted Luck and Rode to the fact that contrary to what Geringer had been telling investors, the fund had not been achieving returns of more than 17 percent by investing 75 percent of investor money in the stock market.  Instead, the lion's share of investor funds was invested in two private startup technology companies., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that, despite Geringer's confession, Luck continued to solicit new investors for the fund by touting Geringer's trading ability and providing investors with fraudulent marketing materials claiming that the fund had earned between 17 and 25 percent annual returns in every year of the fund's operation through investments tied to major stock indices.  Rode, a certified public accountant, continued to mail account statements to investors that contained grossly inflated cash balances that deceived investors about the fund's liquidity.  Several investors made additional investments in the fund and rolled over their investments for additional one-year periods after receiving these fraudulent account statements., \n",
       ", The SEC further alleges that Rode provided investors with account statements that falsely claimed \"MEMBER NASD AND SEC APPROVED.\"  The SEC does not \"approve\" funds or investments in funds, nor was the fund (or any related entity) a member of the NASD (now called the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority - FINRA)., \n",
       ", In addition to the allegations in the original complaint against Geringer and the related entities, the SEC's amended complaint alleges Luck and Rode violated or aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The amended complaint also alleges Rode violated Section 26 of the Exchange Act, which prohibits persons from claiming the SEC has passed on the merits of a security.  Additionally, the SEC seeks financial penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, permanent injunctions, and other relief from both Luck and Rode., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Robert J. Durham and Erin E. Schneider of the San Francisco Regional Office.  The SEC's litigation is being led by Sheila O'Callaghan of the San Francisco office., \n",
       ", Separately today, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California announced that a federal grand jury in San Jose indicted Geringer, Luck, and Rode in connection with their operation of the fund.  The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorney's Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and FINRA for their assistance in this matter., \n",

       ", The SEC Complaint alleges that, from at least early 2007 until 2010, Danny Garber, Michael Manis, Kenneth Yellin, and Jordan Feinstein acquired shares at about 30 to 60 percent off the market price by misrepresenting to the penny stock companies that they intended to hold the shares for investment purposes rather than immediately re-selling them.  Instead, they immediately sold the shares without registering them by purporting to rely on an exemption for transactions that are in compliance with certain types of state law exemptions.  However, no such state law exemptions were applicable to their transactions.  To create the appearance that the claimed exemptions were valid, they created virtual corporate presences in Minnesota, Texas, and Delaware.  The SEC also charged 12 entities that they operated in connection with the scheme., \n",
       ", The SEC's action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations by Garber, Manis, Yellin, Feinstein and the named entities of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.

       ", The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today it filed a civil action against Lee S. Rosen, the former Chairman of the Board of publicly traded New Generation Biofuels Holdings, Inc., alleging that he fraudulently evaded the reporting requirements concerning his ownership interest in New Generation shares held in five separate trusts in violation of the antifraud provisions and beneficial reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the Commission's complaint, at various times from June 2007 through May 2010, Rosen, directly or indirectly profited from the sale of New Generation shares held in two of the five trusts and benefited from using shares in two trusts as payment toward an ultimately unsuccessful purchase of a yacht.  The complaint alleges that Rosen received at least $666,000 in direct payments from sales of New Generation stock held in three of the trusts and from a trustee's individual brokerage account.  The complaint also alleges that Rosen indirectly benefited from using New Generation shares held in two trusts as partial payment in an effort to purchase a yacht.  Further, the complaint alleges that Rosen failed to disclose these transactions and his true holdings in New Generation securities in various Commission filings and that Rosen made false and misleading statements and omissions in Commission filings regarding his true beneficial ownership of New Generation shares., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges Rosen with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b), 13(d) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1, 13d-2, 16a-3, and 16a-8 thereunder.  Rosen has agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations.  Rosen consented to a permanent injunction, and an order requiring him to pay $666,000 in disgorgement, plus $50,484 in prejudgment interest, a $195,000 civil money penalty, and barring him from serving as an officer or director., \n",

       ", SEC Obtains Final Judgment on Consent as to Raj Rajaratnam, \n",
       ", Washington, D.C., December 27, 2012,  — The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that, on December 26, 2012, the Honorable Jed S. Rakoff, United States District Judge, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, entered a Final Judgment, on consent, as to former hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam in the SEC’s insider trading case, , SEC v. Rajat K. Gupta and Raj Rajaratnam,,  Civil Action No. 11-CV-7566 (SDNY) (JSR).  The final judgment orders Rajaratnam to pay $1,299,120 in disgorgement and $147,738, in prejudgment interest, for a total of $1,446,858.  , \n",
       ", The SEC’s complaint, filed October 26, 2011, alleges that, among other things, Rajat K. Gupta tipped his business associate Raj Rajaratnam, Galleon Management’s founder and managing general partner, to confidential information Gupta learned in the course of his duties as a member of the Board of Directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.  The complaint alleges that Gupta disclosed material nonpublic information concerning Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs in September 2008, and concerning Goldman Sachs’s financial results for both the second and the fourth quarter of 2008.  Rajaratnam used the information he learned from Gupta to trade profitably in certain Galleon hedge funds.  By engaging in this conduct, Gupta and Rajaratnam violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  , \n",
       ", On June 15, 2012, in a parallel criminal case arising out of the same facts, Gupta was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and three counts of securities fraud.  On October 24, 2012, Gupta was sentenced to two years in prison and one year of supervised release, and ordered to pay a $5 million criminal fine.  , \n",
       ", The Final Judgment in the SEC’s case orders Rajaratnam to disgorge his share of the profits gained and losses avoided as a result of the insider trading plus prejudgment interest on that amount.  The SEC’s claims against Gupta remain pending., \n",

       ", On December 26, 2012 the Securities and Exchange Commission announced additional charges in an insider trading case against two brokers who traded on nonpublic information ahead of IBM Corporation’s acquisition of SPSS Inc.  , \n",
       ", In an amended complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC is now charging research analyst Trent Martin, who was the brokers’ source of confidential information in an insider trading scheme that yielded more than $1 million in illicit profits.  Martin worked at a brokerage firm in Connecticut and specialized in Australian equity investments, and he learned nonpublic information about the impending IBM-SPSS transaction from an attorney friend who was working on the deal.  Rather than maintaining the confidence of the information, Martin used the information for his own benefit, purchasing SPSS securities and subsequently tipping his roommate Thomas C. Conradt, who traded and tipped his friend and fellow retail broker David J. Weishaus.  Martin was specifically named as their source in instant messages between Conradt and Weishaus about their illegal trading., \n",
       ", The SEC charged Conradt and Weishaus with insider trading on November 29.  Martin, who fled the U.S. to Australia soon after learning about the SEC’s investigation, currently lives in Hong Kong. , \n",
       ", “Martin is a licensed professional who knowingly disregarded insider trading laws to enrich himself, and then fled the United States when he learned of our investigation,” said Daniel M. Hawke, Director of the SEC’s Philadelphia Regional Office.  “Martin could run but he could not hide, as the long arm of the SEC will extend to those who flee the United States hoping to avoid the consequences of their unlawful conduct.”, \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that Martin’s attorney friend expected him to maintain information in confidence and refrain from illegal trading or disclosing it to others.  The attorney sought moral support, reassurance, and advice when he privately told Martin about his new assignment working on the IBM-SPSS acquisition.  The lawyer disclosed to Martin such details as the anticipated transaction price and the identities of the acquiring and target companies while he was describing the magnitude of the assignment. , \n",
       ", According to the SEC’s complaint, Martin attempted to purchase SPSS common stock on the very first business day after learning the nonpublic information from his friend.  His first three orders were cancelled because he did not have sufficient funds in the account to make the purchases, but he later wired $50,000 from his checking account into his brokerage account to purchase SPSS shares., \n",
       ", The SEC’s complaint alleges that Martin, Conradt and Weishaus violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The SEC is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and financial penalties, and a permanent injunction against the brokers., \n",
       ", The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority (ORSA), the New Zealand Securities Commission, and the Australia Securities and Investments Commission.  The SEC has coordinated its action with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, and also appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation., \n",

       ", SEC FILES CHARGES AGAINST TWO OTHERS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FUND MANAGER'S $60 MILLION SCHEME, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", On December 21, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed additional charges in its case against a Northern California fund manager accused of running a $60 million Ponzi-like scheme., \n",
       ", The SEC , previously charged the fund manager, , John A. Geringer, with defrauding investors by touting imaginary trading profits instead of reporting the actual trading losses he had incurred.  The agency today sought court approval to add charges against Christopher A. Luck, of Scotts Valley, Calif., and Keith E. Rode, of Franklin, Wisc., who along with Geringer were principals of GLR Capital Management LLC, which managed the GLR Growth Fund, L.P., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that GLR Capital deceived investors into thinking that the fund was earning double-digit returns by investing 75 percent of its assets in highly liquid investments tied to well-known stock indices like the S&P; 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones.  In reality, the fund was heavily invested in two private, illiquid startup companies, and Geringer's trading for years had generated substantial losses.  Luck and Rode sat on the boards of directors at both startup companies., \n",
       ", \"Luck and Rode knew Geringer had squandered millions of dollars in investor funds and were uniquely positioned to stop the fraud in its tracks,\" said Marc Fagel, Director of the SEC's San Francisco Regional Office.  \"Rather than expose Geringer, they instead chose to join forces and pretend it was business as usual, further concealing the fraud from investors.\", \n",
       ", According to the SEC's amended complaint filed in federal court in San Jose and subject to court approval, Geringer in April 2009 confessed to Luck and Rode that he had been lying to them about the balances in the fund's trading accounts.  This alerted Luck and Rode to the fact that contrary to what Geringer had been telling investors, the fund had not been achieving returns of more than 17 percent by investing 75 percent of investor money in the stock market.  Instead, the lion's share of investor funds was invested in two private startup technology companies., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that, despite Geringer's confession, Luck continued to solicit new investors for the fund by touting Geringer's trading ability and providing investors with fraudulent marketing materials claiming that the fund had earned between 17 and 25 percent annual returns in every year of the fund's operation through investments tied to major stock indices.  Rode, a certified public accountant, continued to mail account statements to investors that contained grossly inflated cash balances that deceived investors about the fund's liquidity.  Several investors made additional investments in the fund and rolled over their investments for additional one-year periods after receiving these fraudulent account statements., \n",
       ", The SEC further alleges that Rode provided investors with account statements that falsely claimed \"MEMBER NASD AND SEC APPROVED.\"  The SEC does not \"approve\" funds or investments in funds, nor was the fund (or any related entity) a member of the NASD (now called the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority - FINRA)., \n",
       ", In addition to the allegations in the original complaint against Geringer and the related entities, the SEC's amended complaint alleges Luck and Rode violated or aided and abetted violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The amended complaint also alleges Rode violated Section 26 of the Exchange Act, which prohibits persons from claiming the SEC has passed on the merits of a security.  Additionally, the SEC seeks financial penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, permanent injunctions, and other relief from both Luck and Rode., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Robert J. Durham and Erin E. Schneider of the San Francisco Regional Office.  The SEC's litigation is being led by Sheila O'Callaghan of the San Francisco office., \n",
       ", Separately today, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California announced that a federal grand jury in San Jose indicted Geringer, Luck, and Rode in connection with their operation of the fund.  The SEC thanks the U.S. Attorney's Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and FINRA for their assistance in this matter., \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged four securities industry professionals with conducting a fraudulent penny stock scheme in which they illegally acquired over a billion unregistered shares in microcap companies at deep discounts and then dumped them on the market while claiming bogus exemptions from the registration provisions of the federal securities laws., \n",
       ", The SEC Complaint alleges that, from at least early 2007 until 2010, Danny Garber, Michael Manis, Kenneth Yellin, and Jordan Feinstein acquired shares at about 30 to 60 percent off the market price by misrepresenting to the penny stock companies that they intended to hold the shares for investment purposes rather than immediately re-selling them.  Instead, they immediately sold the shares without registering them by purporting to rely on an exemption for transactions that are in compliance with certain types of state law exemptions.  However, no such state law exemptions were applicable to their transactions.  To create the appearance that the claimed exemptions were valid, they created virtual corporate presences in Minnesota, Texas, and Delaware.  The SEC also charged 12 entities that they operated in connection with the scheme., \n",
       ", The SEC's action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations by Garber, Manis, Yellin, Feinstein and the named entities of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5.  The SEC's complaint seeks a final judgment, among other things, ordering all of the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and financial penalties; permanently enjoining all the defendants from future violations of the securities laws; and permanently enjoining all the defendants from participating in penny stock offerings., \n",
       ", The New York Regional Office's Michael Paley, Laura Yeu, Elzbieta Wraga, Haimavathi Marlier, Yitzchok Klug and Paul Gizzi conducted the investigation., \n",

       ", The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced today it filed a civil action against Lee S. Rosen, the former Chairman of the Board of publicly traded New Generation Biofuels Holdings, Inc., alleging that he fraudulently evaded the reporting requirements concerning his ownership interest in New Generation shares held in five separate trusts in violation of the antifraud provisions and beneficial reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the Commission's complaint, at various times from June 2007 through May 2010, Rosen, directly or indirectly profited from the sale of New Generation shares held in two of the five trusts and benefited from using shares in two trusts as payment toward an ultimately unsuccessful purchase of a yacht.  The complaint alleges that Rosen received at least $666,000 in direct payments from sales of New Generation stock held in three of the trusts and from a trustee's individual brokerage account.  The complaint also alleges that Rosen indirectly benefited from using New Generation shares held in two trusts as partial payment in an effort to purchase a yacht.  Further, the complaint alleges that Rosen failed to disclose these transactions and his true holdings in New Generation securities in various Commission filings and that Rosen made false and misleading statements and omissions in Commission filings regarding his true beneficial ownership of New Generation shares., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges Rosen with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b), 13(d) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13d-1, 13d-2, 16a-3, and 16a-8 thereunder.  Rosen has agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations.  Rosen consented to a permanent injunction, and an order requiring him to pay $666,000 in disgorgement, plus $50,484 in prejudgment interest, a $195,000 civil money penalty, and barring him from serving as an officer or director., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Miami Regional Office by Senior Counsel Jorge L. Riera and Accountant Karaz S. Zaki under the supervision of Assistant Regional Director Elisha L. Frank.  Christine Nestor will lead the SEC's litigation., \n",
