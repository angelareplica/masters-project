       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged the largest telecommunications provider in Hungary and three of its former top executives with bribing government and political party officials in Macedonia and Montenegro to win business and shut out competition in the telecommunications industry.  , \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that three senior executives at Magyar Telekom Plc. orchestrated, approved, and executed a plan to bribe Macedonian officials in 2005 and 2006 to prevent the introduction of a new competitor and gain other regulatory benefits.  Magyar Telekom’s subsidiaries in Macedonia made illegal payments of approximately $6 million under the guise of bogus consulting and marketing contracts.  The same executives orchestrated a second scheme in 2005 in Montenegro related to Magyar Telekom’s acquisition of the state-owned telecommunications company there.  Magyar Telekom paid approximately $9 million through four sham contracts to funnel money to government officials in Montenegro., \n",
       ", Magyar Telekom’s parent company Deutsche Telekom AG also is charged with books and records and internal controls violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)., \n",
       ", Magyar Telekom agreed to settle the SEC’s charges by paying more than $31.2 million in disgorgement and pre-judgment interest.  Magyar Telekom also agreed to pay a $59.6 million criminal penalty as part of a deferred prosecution agreement announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice.  Deutsche Telekom settled the SEC’s charges, and as part of a non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice agreed to pay a penalty of $4.36 million., \n",

       ", According to the SEC’s complaints filed in the Southern District of New York, in the wake of legislation intended to liberalize the Macedonian telecommunications market, Magyar Telekom entered into a secret agreement entitled the “Protocol of Cooperation” with senior Macedonian government officials to delay or preclude the issuance of a license to a new competitor and mitigate other adverse effects of the new law.  To win their support, Magyar Telekom paid €4.875 million to a third-party intermediary under a series of sham contracts with the intention that the intermediary would forward money to the government officials.  Magyar Telekom also promised a Macedonian political party the opportunity to designate the beneficiary of a business venture in exchange for the party’s support., \n",
       ", The SEC further alleges that in Montenegro, Magyar Telekom used intermediaries to pay bribes to government officials in return for their support of Magyar Telekom’s acquisition of the state-owned telecommunications company on terms favorable to Magyar Telekom.  At least two Montenegrin government officials involved in the acquisition received payments made through the bogus contracts.  A family member of a top Montenegrin government official also received payments., ...]</td>\n",

       ", Judgment Entered Against Shawn R. Merriman Pursuant to Settlement, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on December 23, 2011, the United States District Court for the District of Colorado in Denver entered judgment against Shawn R. Merriman.  According to the Commission’s complaint, from 1994 to 2009, Merriman conducted a Ponzi scheme through entities under his control raising approximately $20 million.  The complaint alleged that Merriman fraudulently represented to investors that he would invest their funds in stocks and options generating annual returns of 7 to 20%, when in fact he used investor funds to pay investor returns and to support his lavish lifestyle. , \n",
       ", To resolve the Commission’s charges, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Merriman consented to the entry of a judgment enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The judgment further ordered Merriman liable for disgorgement of $20,124,183.13 which was deemed satisfied by the order of restitution entered on September 14, 2010 against Merriman in the related criminal case, , U.S. v. Merriman, , Case No. 09-cr-00369-MSK-01 (D. Colo.).  The judgment did not impose a civil penalty in light of the criminal sanctions ordered against Merriman in the criminal case.  Merriman is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment of 151 months after pleading guilty to one count of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341., \n",
       ", Upon motion by the Commission, the District Court in Denver dismissed the pending claims against Merriman’s entities Market Street Advisors, LLC-1, LLC-2, Marque LLC-3, LLC-4 and Relief Defendant Impressions Everlasting. These entities are defunct and their assets, if any, were seized in connection with the criminal case against Merriman., \n",

       ", Following Contested Evidentiary Hearing, SEC Obtains Preliminary and Permanent Injunctions and Related Relief Against New York Businessman and Two Houston-area Firms Who Conducted a Fraudulent $10 Million Note Offering, \n",
       ", On August 10, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against Damian Omar Valdez of New York and two Houston-area firms he controlled, Evolution Capital Advisors (“Evolution Capital”) and Evolution Investment Group I (“EIGI”).  Evolution Capital was an investment adviser registered with the Commission until June 2010.  The firms and Valdez raised at least $10 million from more than 80 investors through two fraudulent note offerings., \n",
       ", After a contested evidentiary hearing on October 19 and 20, 2011, the Court found that: (1) Valdez, Evolution Capital, and EIGI misled investors to believe that the notes were safe and secured by assets guaranteed by the United States government; (2) the defendants falsely promised to use leverage to purchase the assets securing the notes; (3) the assets securing the notes were subject to significant undisclosed default and prepayment risk; (4) the defendants paid themselves more than $2.4 million in fees and expenses and used approximately $2.7 million from the second note offering to make Ponzi payments to investors in the first note offering; (5) because of defaults and prepayments on the underlying assets, failure to obtain leverage, and excessive Ponzi payments and fees, the defendants lacked sufficient assets to repay investors in accordance with the notes; and (6) the defendants would have continued taking all monies from the account each  month as “profit” had the Commission not brought its enforcement action.  The Court specifically found that Defendant Valdez acted with fraudulent intent., \n",
       ", Based on these findings, the Court granted the Commission’s motion for preliminary and permanent injunction, asset freeze, and appointment of a receiver.  The Court also permanently froze the defendants’ assets.  In addition, the Court specifically enjoined the defendants against further violations of the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission’s requests for disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, as well as civil penalties, remain pending.   , \n",

       ", Text goes here, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged GE Funding Capital Market Services with securities fraud for participating in a wide-ranging scheme involving the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of municipal securities., \n",
       ", GE Funding CMS agreed to settle the SEC's charges by paying approximately $25 million that will be returned to affected municipalities or conduit borrowers.  The firm also entered into agreements with the Department of Justice, Internal Revenue Service, and a coalition of 25 state attorneys general and will pay an additional $45.35 million., \n",
       ", The settlements arise from extensive law enforcement investigations into widespread corruption in the municipal reinvestment industry.  In the past year, federal and state authorities have reached settlements with four other financial firms, and 18 individuals have been indicted or pled guilty, including three former GE Funding CMS traders., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, in addition to fraudulently manipulating bids, GE Funding CMS made improper, undisclosed payments to certain bidding agents in the form of swap fees that were inflated or unearned.  These payments were in exchange for the assistance of bidding agents in controlling and manipulating the competitive bidding process., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that from August 1999 to October 2004, GE Funding CMS illegally generated millions of dollars by fraudulently manipulating at least 328 municipal bond reinvestment transactions in 44 states and Puerto Rico.  GE Funding CMS won numerous bids through a practice of \"last looks\" in which it obtained information regarding competitor bids and either raised a losing bid to a winning bid or reduced its winning bid to a lower amount so that it could make more profit on the transaction.  In connection with other bids, GE Funding CMS deliberately submitted purposely non-winning bids to facilitate bids set up in advance by certain bidding agents for other providers to win.  GE Funding CMS's fraudulent conduct also jeopardized the tax-exempt status of billions of dollars in municipal securities because the supposed competitive bidding process that establishes the fair market value of the investment was corrupted., \n",
       ", In settling the SEC's charges, GE Funding CMS agreed to pay a $10.5 million penalty along with disgorgement of $10,625,775 with prejudgment interest of $3,775,987.  GE Funding CMS consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining it from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The Commission recognizes GE Funding CMS's cooperation in its investigation., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigations have been conducted by Deputy Chief Mark R. Zehner and Assistant Municipal Securities Counsel Denise D. Colliers, who are members of the Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit in the Philadelphia Regional Office.  The SEC thanks the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their cooperation and assistance in this matter., \n",

       ", Court Enters $49 Million Final Judgment Against Alfred S. Teo, Sr. and MAAA Trust, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on December 21, 2011, United States District Court Judge Susan D. Wigenton entered a final judgment ordering defendants Alfred S. Teo, Sr. and the MAAA Trust, a trust Teo controlled, to pay a total of $49,493,143.15 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties for false filings regarding their Musicland Stores Corporation stock.  In particular, the Court ordered Teo and the Trust to pay $17,422,054.13 in disgorgement plus $14,649,034.89 in prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $17,422,054.13.  These amounts are in addition to (i) $996,782.68 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest Teo paid for his insider trading violations pursuant to the Court’s previous order of March 15, 2010, and (ii) a $1 million fine that Teo paid in a parallel criminal action for insider trading.  The Court also enjoined Teo and the Trust from further violations of Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13d-1, 13d-2 and 16a-3 thereunder.  Previously, the Court had enjoined Teo from further violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, and barred him from serving as an officer and director of a public company., \n",
       ", On May 25, 2011, following a ten day trial, a jury sitting in Newark, New Jersey returned a verdict in favor of the Commission finding Teo liable for securities fraud and disclosure violations on all counts against him and finding the Trust liable for disclosure violations.  Prior to the trial, on August 10, 2010, the Court granted the Commission’s motion for summary judgment against Teo finding him liable for violations of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder., \n",
       ", The Commission’s complaint, filed on April 22, 2004, charged Teo and others with insider trading and making false Commission filings.  Specifically, Teo and ten of his relatives, friends and colleagues engaged in insider trading in Musicland and C-Cube Microsystems, Inc. stock.  Teo, a major Musicland shareholder, learned about a tender offer for Musicland, and in breach of a duty of trust and confidence to Musicland, he purchased Musicland stock on the basis of this information prior to the company’s December 7, 2000 public announcement of the tender offer.  Teo tipped eight others with this information, who purchased Musicland stock prior to the Musicland announcement.  Teo also engaged in insider trading in the securities of C-Cube.  Teo, a director of Cirrus Logic, Inc., which had been negotiating to acquire C-Cube, misappropriated from Cirrus material, non-public information regarding the negotiations, and he purchased C-Cube stock shortly before C-Cube announced on March 26, 2001 that it had agreed to be acquired by another company.  Teo tipped his business partner, defendant Mitch Sacks, with this information, who purchased C-Cube stock prior to the C-Cube announcement.  Teo also filed false information with the Commission and deceived the investing public regarding his Musicland stock ownership.  Between July 1998 and January 2001, Teo, the Trust, and Teren Seto Handelman, the Trust’s trustee and Teo’s sister-in-law, filed multiple false and misleading Forms 13D with the Commission, and failed to make required filings, thereby materially misrepresenting their ownership of Musicland stock.  Teo made false filings to avoid triggering Musicland’s shareholders rights plan, or “poison pill,” which Teo understood would have significantly diluted his stock causing massive losses to him.  Instead, Teo’s fraud enabled him to secretly purchase millions of Musicland shares well above the poison pill threshold, which he eventually sold, receiving illicit profits., \n",
       ", Between May 3, 2004, and January 3, 2011, the Court entered final judgments against Teo’s tippees: defendants Teren Seto Handelman (Teo’s sister-in-law), Mitch Sacks (Teo’s business partner), Phil Sacks (Teo’s tennis partner and Mitch Sacks’ father), John Reier (CFO of Teo’s companies), Larry Rosen (Teo’s friend), Rich Herron (Teo’s yachting friend), Charles Fortune, Jerrold Johnston and Mark Lauzon (Teo’s business associates), David Ross (Teo’s yacht builder), and relief defendant James Ruffolo.  These defendants and relief defendant consented to the entry of judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint.  On March 15, 2010, the Court entered a partial judgment on consent against Teo to settle the Commission’s insider trading charges against him, and the Court ordered him to pay $996,782.68 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, enjoined him against further violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, and barred him from serving as an officer or director of any public company.  Prior to the December 21, 2011 final judgment, the Court ordered a total of $3,869,647.76 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties against Teo and his tippees., \n",
       ", In a separate action, the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey prosecuted Teo for violations of the federal securities laws.  On June 27, 2006, after a six week trial, Teo pled guilty to insider trading charges.  Thereafter, on February 6, 2007, Teo was sentenced to 30 months in prison, followed by two years supervised release and ordered to pay a $1 million fine.  , United States v. Alfred S. Teo, , 04-Cr.-583 (KSH) (D.N.J.) , \n",
       ", Teo, age 65 and a resident of Kinnelon, New Jersey and Fisher Island, Florida, is the Chairman of several private companies which produce industrial plastics.  Teo’s companies are some of the largest producers of plastic bags in North America.  Teo was a director and audit committee member of two public companies:  Navarre Corp. from May 1, 1998 to April 22, 2004; and Cirrus from July 21, 1998 to April 10, 2001. , \n",

       ", The SEC alleges that three senior executives at Magyar Telekom Plc. orchestrated, approved, and executed a plan to bribe Macedonian officials in 2005 and 2006 to prevent the introduction of a new competitor and gain other regulatory benefits.  Magyar Telekom’s subsidiaries in Macedonia made illegal payments of approximately $6 million under the guise of bogus consulting and marketing contracts.  The same executives orchestrated a second scheme in 2005 in Montenegro related to Magyar Telekom’s acquisition of the state-owned telecommunications company there.  Magyar Telekom paid approximately $9 million through four sham contracts to funnel money to government officials in Montenegro., \n",

To win their support, Magyar Telekom paid €4.875 million to a third-party intermediary under a series of sham contracts with the intention that the intermediary would forward money to the government officials.  Magyar Telekom also promised a Macedonian political party the opportunity to designate the beneficiary of a business venture in exchange for the party’s support., \n",

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on December 23, 2011, the United States District Court for the District of Colorado in Denver entered judgment against Shawn R. Merriman.  According to the Commission’s complaint, from 1994 to 2009, Merriman conducted a Ponzi scheme through entities under his control raising approximately $20 million.  The complaint alleged that Merriman fraudulently represented to investors that he would invest their funds in stocks and options generating annual returns of 7 to 20%, when in fact he used investor funds to pay investor returns and to support his lavish lifestyle. , \n",
       ", To resolve the Commission’s charges, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Merriman consented to the entry of a judgment enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The judgment further ordered Merriman liable for disgorgement of $20,124,183.13 which was deemed satisfied by the order of restitution entered on September 14, 2010 against Merriman in the related criminal case, , U.S. v. Merriman, , Case No. 09-cr-00369-MSK-01 (D. Colo.).  The judgment did not impose a civil penalty in light of the criminal sanctions ordered against Merriman in the criminal case.  Merriman is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment of 151 months after pleading guilty to one count of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341., \n",
       ", Upon motion by the Commission, the District Court in Denver dismissed the pending claims against Merriman’s entities Market Street Advisors, LLC-1, LLC-2, Marque LLC-3, LLC-4 and Relief Defendant Impressions Everlasting. These entities are defunct and their assets, if any, were seized in connection with the criminal case against Merriman., \n",

       ", Securities and Exchange Commission v. Evolution Capital Advisors, et al., , Civ. Action No. 4:11-cv-02945 (United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division) (Miller, J.)., \n",
       ", Following Contested Evidentiary Hearing, SEC Obtains Preliminary and Permanent Injunctions and Related Relief Against New York Businessman and Two Houston-area Firms Who Conducted a Fraudulent $10 Million Note Offering, \n",
       ", On August 10, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against Damian Omar Valdez of New York and two Houston-area firms he controlled, Evolution Capital Advisors (“Evolution Capital”) and Evolution Investment Group I (“EIGI”).  Evolution Capital was an investment adviser registered with the Commission until June 2010.  The firms and Valdez raised at least $10 million from more than 80 investors through two fraudulent note offerings., \n",
       ", After a contested evidentiary hearing on October 19 and 20, 2011, the Court found that: (1) Valdez, Evolution Capital, and EIGI misled investors to believe that the notes were safe and secured by assets guaranteed by the United States government; (2) the defendants falsely promised to use leverage to purchase the assets securing the notes; (3) the assets securing the notes were subject to significant undisclosed default and prepayment risk; (4) the defendants paid themselves more than $2.4 million in fees and expenses and used approximately $2.7 million from the second note offering to make Ponzi payments to investors in the first note offering; (5) because of defaults and prepayments on the underlying assets, failure to obtain leverage, and excessive Ponzi payments and fees, the defendants lacked sufficient assets to repay investors in accordance with the notes; and (6) the defendants would have continued taking all monies from the account each  month as “profit” had the Commission not brought its enforcement action.  The Court specifically found that Defendant Valdez acted with fraudulent intent., \n",
       ", Based on these findings, the Court granted the Commission’s motion for preliminary and permanent injunction, asset freeze, and appointment of a receiver.  The Court also permanently froze the defendants’ assets.  In addition, the Court specifically enjoined the defendants against further violations of the anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Commission’s requests for disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, as well as civil penalties, remain pending.   , \n",

       ", Securities and Exchange Commission v. GE Funding Capital Market Services, Inc., , Civil Action No.  2:11-cv-07465-WJM-MF (D.N.J. December 23 2011), \n",

       ", Text goes here, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged GE Funding Capital Market Services with securities fraud for participating in a wide-ranging scheme involving the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of municipal securities., \n",
       ", GE Funding CMS agreed to settle the SEC's charges by paying approximately $25 million that will be returned to affected municipalities or conduit borrowers.  The firm also entered into agreements with the Department of Justice, Internal Revenue Service, and a coalition of 25 state attorneys general and will pay an additional $45.35 million., \n",
       ", The settlements arise from extensive law enforcement investigations into widespread corruption in the municipal reinvestment industry.  In the past year, federal and state authorities have reached settlements with four other financial firms, and 18 individuals have been indicted or pled guilty, including three former GE Funding CMS traders., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, in addition to fraudulently manipulating bids, GE Funding CMS made improper, undisclosed payments to certain bidding agents in the form of swap fees that were inflated or unearned.  These payments were in exchange for the assistance of bidding agents in controlling and manipulating the competitive bidding process., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that from August 1999 to October 2004, GE Funding CMS illegally generated millions of dollars by fraudulently manipulating at least 328 municipal bond reinvestment transactions in 44 states and Puerto Rico.  GE Funding CMS won numerous bids through a practice of \"last looks\" in which it obtained information regarding competitor bids and either raised a losing bid to a winning bid or reduced its winning bid to a lower amount so that it could make more profit on the transaction.  In connection with other bids, GE Funding CMS deliberately submitted purposely non-winning bids to facilitate bids set up in advance by certain bidding agents for other providers to win.  GE Funding CMS's fraudulent conduct also jeopardized the tax-exempt status of billions of dollars in municipal securities because the supposed competitive bidding process that establishes the fair market value of the investment was corrupted., \n",
       ", In settling the SEC's charges, GE Funding CMS agreed to pay a $10.5 million penalty along with disgorgement of $10,625,775 with prejudgment interest of $3,775,987.  GE Funding CMS consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining it from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The Commission recognizes GE Funding CMS's cooperation in its investigation., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigations have been conducted by Deputy Chief Mark R. Zehner and Assistant Municipal Securities Counsel Denise D. Colliers, who are members of the Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit in the Philadelphia Regional Office.  The SEC thanks the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their cooperation and assistance in this matter., \n",

       ", Securities and Exchange Commission v. Alfred S. Teo, Sr., et al., , Civil Action No. 04-1815-SDW-MCA (D. N.J.), \n",
       ", Court Enters $49 Million Final Judgment Against Alfred S. Teo, Sr. and MAAA Trust, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on December 21, 2011, United States District Court Judge Susan D. Wigenton entered a final judgment ordering defendants Alfred S. Teo, Sr. and the MAAA Trust, a trust Teo controlled, to pay a total of $49,493,143.15 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties for false filings regarding their Musicland Stores Corporation stock.  In particular, the Court ordered Teo and the Trust to pay $17,422,054.13 in disgorgement plus $14,649,034.89 in prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $17,422,054.13.  These amounts are in addition to (i) $996,782.68 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest Teo paid for his insider trading violations pursuant to the Court’s previous order of March 15, 2010, and (ii) a $1 million fine that Teo paid in a parallel criminal action for insider trading.  The Court also enjoined Teo and the Trust from further violations of Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13d-1, 13d-2 and 16a-3 thereunder.  Previously, the Court had enjoined Teo from further violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, and barred him from serving as an officer and director of a public company., \n",
       ", On May 25, 2011, following a ten day trial, a jury sitting in Newark, New Jersey returned a verdict in favor of the Commission finding Teo liable for securities fraud and disclosure violations on all counts against him and finding the Trust liable for disclosure violations.  Prior to the trial, on August 10, 2010, the Court granted the Commission’s motion for summary judgment against Teo finding him liable for violations of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder., \n",
       ", The Commission’s complaint, filed on April 22, 2004, charged Teo and others with insider trading and making false Commission filings.  Specifically, Teo and ten of his relatives, friends and colleagues engaged in insider trading in Musicland and C-Cube Microsystems, Inc. stock.  Teo, a major Musicland shareholder, learned about a tender offer for Musicland, and in breach of a duty of trust and confidence to Musicland, he purchased Musicland stock on the basis of this information prior to the company’s December 7, 2000 public announcement of the tender offer.  Teo tipped eight others with this information, who purchased Musicland stock prior to the Musicland announcement.  Teo also engaged in insider trading in the securities of C-Cube.  Teo, a director of Cirrus Logic, Inc., which had been negotiating to acquire C-Cube, misappropriated from Cirrus material, non-public information regarding the negotiations, and he purchased C-Cube stock shortly before C-Cube announced on March 26, 2001 that it had agreed to be acquired by another company.  Teo tipped his business partner, defendant Mitch Sacks, with this information, who purchased C-Cube stock prior to the C-Cube announcement.  Teo also filed false information with the Commission and deceived the investing public regarding his Musicland stock ownership.  Between July 1998 and January 2001, Teo, the Trust, and Teren Seto Handelman, the Trust’s trustee and Teo’s sister-in-law, filed multiple false and misleading Forms 13D with the Commission, and failed to make required filings, thereby materially misrepresenting their ownership of Musicland stock.  Teo made false filings to avoid triggering Musicland’s shareholders rights plan, or “poison pill,” which Teo understood would have significantly diluted his stock causing massive losses to him.  Instead, Teo’s fraud enabled him to secretly purchase millions of Musicland shares well above the poison pill threshold, which he eventually sold, receiving illicit profits., \n",
       ", Between May 3, 2004, and January 3, 2011, the Court entered final judgments against Teo’s tippees: defendants Teren Seto Handelman (Teo’s sister-in-law), Mitch Sacks (Teo’s business partner), Phil Sacks (Teo’s tennis partner and Mitch Sacks’ father), John Reier (CFO of Teo’s companies), Larry Rosen (Teo’s friend), Rich Herron (Teo’s yachting friend), Charles Fortune, Jerrold Johnston and Mark Lauzon (Teo’s business associates), David Ross (Teo’s yacht builder), and relief defendant James Ruffolo.  These defendants and relief defendant consented to the entry of judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s complaint.  On March 15, 2010, the Court entered a partial judgment on consent against Teo to settle the Commission’s insider trading charges against him, and the Court ordered him to pay $996,782.68 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, enjoined him against further violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder, and barred him from serving as an officer or director of any public company.  Prior to the December 21, 2011 final judgment, the Court ordered a total of $3,869,647.76 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties against Teo and his tippees., \n",
       ", In a separate action, the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey prosecuted Teo for violations of the federal securities laws.  On June 27, 2006, after a six week trial, Teo pled guilty to insider trading charges.  Thereafter, on February 6, 2007, Teo was sentenced to 30 months in prison, followed by two years supervised release and ordered to pay a $1 million fine.  , United States v. Alfred S. Teo, , 04-Cr.-583 (KSH) (D.N.J.) , \n",
       ", Teo, age 65 and a resident of Kinnelon, New Jersey and Fisher Island, Florida, is the Chairman of several private companies which produce industrial plastics.  Teo’s companies are some of the largest producers of plastic bags in North America.  Teo was a director and audit committee member of two public companies:  Navarre Corp. from May 1, 1998 to April 22, 2004; and Cirrus from July 21, 1998 to April 10, 2001. , \n",
