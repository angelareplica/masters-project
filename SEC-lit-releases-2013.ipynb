       ", SEC Charges Archer-Daniels-Midland Company with FCPA Violations, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged global food processor Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM) for failing to prevent illicit payments made by foreign subsidiaries to Ukrainian government officials in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)., \n",
       ", An SEC investigation found that ADM's subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine paid $21 million in bribes through intermediaries to secure the release of value-added tax (VAT) refunds. The payments were then concealed by improperly recording the transactions in accounting records as insurance premiums and other purported business expenses. ADM had insufficient anti-bribery compliance controls and made approximately $33 million in illegal profits as a result of the bribery by its subsidiaries., \n",
       ", ADM, which is based in Decatur, Ill., has agreed to pay more than $36 million to settle the SEC's charges. In a parallel action, the U.S. Department of Justice today announced a non-prosecution agreement with ADM and criminal charges against an ADM subsidiary that has agreed to pay $17.8 million in criminal fines., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, the bribery occurred from 2002 to 2008. Ukraine imposed a 20 percent VAT on goods purchased in its country. If the goods were exported, the exporter could apply for a refund of the VAT already paid to the government on those goods. However, at times the Ukrainian government delayed paying VAT refunds it owed or did not make any refund payments at all. On these occasions, the outstanding amount of VAT refunds owed to ADM's Ukraine affiliate reached as high as $46 million., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that in order to obtain the VAT refunds that the Ukraine government was withholding, ADM's subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine devised several schemes to bribe Ukraine government officials to release the money. The bribes paid were generally 18 to 20 percent of the corresponding VAT refunds. For example, the subsidiaries artificially inflated commodities contracts with a Ukrainian shipping company to provide bribe payments to government officials. In another scheme, the subsidiaries created phony insurance contracts with an insurance company that included false premiums passed on to Ukraine government officials. The misconduct went unchecked by ADM for several years because of its deficient and decentralized system of FCPA oversight over subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges ADM with violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. ADM consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering the company to pay disgorgement of $33,342,012 plus prejudgment interest of $3,125,354. The final judgment also permanently enjoins ADM from violating those sections of the Exchange Act, and requires the company to report on its FCPA compliance efforts for a three-year period. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC took into account ADM's cooperation and significant remedial measures, including self-reporting the matter, implementing a comprehensive new compliance program throughout its operations, and terminating employees involved in the misconduct., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Nicholas A. Brady and supervised by Moira T. Roberts and Anita B. Bandy. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Justice Department's Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation., \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ",  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on December 23, 2013, it charged David F. Marchand, of Campbell, California, a former Board Assistant to the Co-Chief Executive Officer of SAP AG, with unlawful insider trading in the securities of three issuers:  SuccessFactors, Inc. (“SuccessFactors”), Ariba, Inc. (“Ariba”) and SAP AG (“SAP”). According to the SEC’s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, Marchand made a total of $43,500 in illicit profits through his trading. , \n",
       ",  The SEC’s complaint alleges that, while in possession of material nonpublic information concerning SAP’s intention to acquire SuccessFactors, Marchand purchased SuccessFactors common stock between November 21, 2011 and November 28, 2011, in advance of the December 3, 2011 public announcement that SAP and SuccessFactors had entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which a subsidiary of SAP would acquire SuccessFactors for $40 per share in a tender offer.  The price of SuccessFactors common stock increased 51.4 percent after the announcement, and Marchand sold his shares, realizing illicit profits of $28,061. , \n",
       ",  The complaint further alleges that, in early January 2012, Marchand became aware of material nonpublic information regarding SAP’s favorable financial performance for the fourth quarter and year ended 2011, including its “best ever” software revenue numbers.  After learning this information, Marchand purchased SAP American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) prior to SAP’s January 13, 2012 public release of its preliminary fourth quarter 2011 results.  Marchand sold his SAP ADRs after the announcement, realizing illicit profits of $2,157. , \n",
       ",  The SEC also alleges that, a few months later, after he learned material nonpublic information about SAP’s intentions to acquire Ariba, Marchand purchased Ariba common stock on April 16, 2012, May 2, 2012 and May 8, 2012, in advance of the May 22, 2012 public announcement that a subsidiary of SAP and Ariba had entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which a subsidiary of SAP would acquire Ariba for $45 per share of common stock.  The price of Ariba common stock increased approximately 19 percent after the announcement, and Marchand sold his Ariba shares, realizing illegal profits of $13,282. , \n",
       ",  Marchand has consented, without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder; requiring him to pay $43,500 in disgorgement, $2,155 in prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $43,500.  The settlement is subject to court approval. , \n",

       ", SEC Charges Woman and Stepson for Involvment in Zeekrewards Pyramid and Ponzi Scheme; Parallel Criminal Charges and Plea Agreements Also Announced, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", On December 20, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina against Dawn Wright-Olivares and Daniel Olivares for their roles in perpetrating the fraudulent unregistered offer and sale of securities through Rex Venture Group LLC d/b/a ZeekRewards.com, an internet-based combined Ponzi and pyramid scheme. According to the Complaint, from approximately January 2011 until August 2012 when the ZeekRewards website was shut down, Rex Venture Group raised more than $850 million from approximately one million internet customers nationwide and overseas through the website. Both defendants have agreed to settle the Commission’s allegations against them, and their settlement papers were submitted to the Court for its consideration., \n",
       ", The Complaint alleged that defendants solicited investors through the internet and other means to participate in the ZeekRewards program, a self-described “affiliate advertising division” for the companion website, Zeekler.com, through which the defendants operated penny auctions. The ZeekRewards program offered customers several ways to earn money, two of which — the “Retail Profit Pool” and the “Matrix” — involved purchasing securities in the form of investment contracts. These securities offerings were not registered with the SEC as required under the federal securities laws. , \n",
       ", According to the Complaint, Wright-Olivares and others lured investors to ZeekRewards by promising investors a share of the company’s daily net profits in the form of daily profit share awards. The company’s purported calculations consistently resulted in daily award averaging approximately 1.5 percent per day, fraudulently conveying the false impression that the company was extremely profitable. In fact, the daily award percentage was fabricated and investor payouts bore no relation to the company’s net profits. Approximately 98% of ZeekRewards’ total revenues and the “net profits” paid to investors were comprised of funds received from new investors in classic Ponzi scheme fashion. When the company was shut down in August 2012, it was teetering on collapse. , \n",
       ", The Complaint further alleged that Wright-Olivares conceived of the idea for operating penny auctions, helped develop the technical specifications for the Zeekler.com program and its key features, marketed ZeekRewards to investors, managed some of RVG’s operations, and helped design and implement features that concealed the fraud. She was a principal spokesperson for ZeekRewards, and she also served as chief operating officer from September 2011 to June 2012. For the duration of the company’s existence, Olivares was the chief architect of the company’s computer databases that tracked all investments (including subscription and bid purchases), managed the electronic operations, and perpetuated the illusion of a successful retail business. , \n",
       ", The Commission alleged that Wright-Olivares offered and sold securities in violation of the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act, and both defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the Section 17 of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Complaint requested permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants. Without denying the allegations—and while also admitting the facts set forth in the Factual Summary filed contemporaneously with their respective plea agreements in the parallel criminal case — both defendants have agreed to settle the Commission’s charges against them, and their settlement papers were submitted to the Court for its consideration. In particular, both consented to permanent injunctions against future violations of the respective registration and antifraud provisions with which they were each charged. Wright-Olivares also agreed to disgorge at least $8,184,064.94 and Olivares agreed to disgorge at least $3,272,934.58 — amounts that represent the entirety of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest. In light of their anticipated incarceration, no civil penalty will be imposed. The settlements are subject to approval by the court. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of North Carolina simultaneously announced criminal charges against, and plea agreements by, the pair. , \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on December 20, 2013 it obtained a final judgment against Yonghui Zhang, the remaining defendant in an insider trading case involving the securities of Beijing-based Global Education and Technology Group, Ltd.  The case, which was originally filed in the U.S. District Court in Chicago on December 5, 2011, charged eight defendants, including Zhang, with insider trading after they reaped more than $2.8 million in profits by trading in advance of a publicly announced merger between Global Education and London-based Pearson plc.  , \n",
       ", The SEC’s first amended complaint, filed on December 13, 2011, alleged that Yonghui Zhang, a Global Education employee and brother of David Zhang, CEO of Global Education, purchased 7,900 shares of Global Education on the last trading day before the merger announcement.  The first amended complaint also alleged that Pearson and Global Education each announced before trading began on November 21, 2011 that Pearson agreed to acquire all of Global Education’s outstanding stock for $294 million. Global Education’s stock price increased 97 percent that day, from $5.37 to $10.60.  The SEC alleged that Zhang profited by more than $40,000 from his illegal trading.  , \n",
       ", Zhang consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering Zhang to pay disgorgement of $40,494, and ordering a civil penalty against Zhang in the amount of $40,494.

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ",  The Commission today settled a pending civil action against Advanced Cell Technology, Inc. (“Advanced Cell”), arising out of Advanced Cell’s issuance of hundreds of millions of unregistered shares of common stock on thirteen separate occasions without qualifying for any exemption from registration.  The settlement, which was filed with the Court earlier today, is subject to the Court’s approval.  , \n",
       ",  In its Complaint filed on May 30, 2012, the Commission alleged that seven defendants, including Advanced Cell, a biotechnology company with headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts, violated the federal securities laws by engaging in the illegal unregistered distribution of billions of shares of penny stocks through the repeated misuse of the exemption from registration contained in Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Section 3(a)(10) permits a company to issue common stock to public investors other than pursuant to an effective registration statement “in exchange for one or more bona fide outstanding securities, claims or property interests  . . . where the terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange are approved after a hearing [held before a court or other governmental authority authorized to conduct such hearings] upon the fairness of such terms and conditions.”  The Section 3(a)(10) exemption may not be relied upon for capital formation by issuers, and it was improperly used for that purpose in these transactions.   , \n",
       ",  According to the Commission’s Complaint, in or about early 2006, Mark A. Lefkowitz, a penny stock financier, developed an illegal strategy for penny stock issuers to pay off past due debts and also raise capital by issuing stock purportedly pursuant to the Section 3(a)(10) exemption.  The Complaint alleges that in September 2008, Lefkowitz introduced the strategy to William Caldwell IV, who was then the Chief Executive Officer of Advanced Cell.   , \n",
       ",  The Complaint alleges that from September 2008 through January 2009, pursuant to an agreement between Lefkowitz and Caldwell, several entities affiliated with Lefkowitz (collectively, the “Lefkowitz Related Entities”) purchased past due debts of Advanced Cell from various Advanced Cell debtholders.  Shortly after a Lefkowitz Related Entity acquired each debt, Lefkowitz and Caldwell agreed on the terms of a settlement, and the Lefkowitz Related Entity filed a lawsuit against Advanced Cell in a Florida state court purportedly to collect on the debt.  The principal purpose of the lawsuits, according to the Complaint, was to present the settlements to the Florida state court for a fairness hearing, as required by Section 3(a)(10).     , \n",
       ",  The Complaint alleges that, in each instance, the Florida state court found the settlements to be fair and entered an order granting a Section 3(a)(10) exemption.  However, the Commission’s Complaint asserts that the parties never informed the Florida state court of the full terms and conditions of the settlements, thereby compromising the fairness hearings.  According to the Complaint, the parties falsely represented to the Florida state court that they were settling for the face value of the past due debts and did not inform the Florida state court of the actual market value of the settlement shares or that the market value of the shares greatly exceeded the amount of the debts that were to be extinguished.  Nor was the Florida state court told that the Lefkowitz Related Entities had agreed to sell the settlement shares quickly and remit a substantial portion of the sales proceeds to Advanced Cell.  , \n",
       ",  According to the Complaint, Advanced Cell ultimately issued a total of 260,115,983 shares of unrestricted common stock to settle the thirteen lawsuits filed against it by the Lefkowitz Related Entities.  The settlement shares, which had a total market value of approximately $9,230,000 as of the respective settlement dates, were issued to satisfy past due debts totaling approximately $1,110,000.  According to the Complaint, after retaining a portion of the profits from the sale of the shares for themselves, the Lefkowitz Related Entities remitted $3.5 million to Advanced Cell.   , \n",
       ",  The Complaint alleges that, as a result of the foregoing, Advanced Cell’s unregistered distributions to the Lefkowitz Related Entities violated Section 5 of the Securities Act.  The Complaint also alleges that Advanced Cell failed to timely disclose the settlement agreements and its issuance of unregistered shares of common stock in connection with the Section 3(a)(10) settlements by filing current reports on Forms 8-K with the Commission.   , \n",
       ",  The proposed final judgment would enjoin Advanced Cell from violating Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13a-11 thereunder.  It would also order Advanced Cell to disgorge $3.5 million in ill-gotten payments from the Lefkowitz Related Entities, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $586,619, for a total of $4,086,619, but would not impose a civil penalty based upon Advanced Cell’s financial condition.  Advanced Cell consented to the entry of the proposed Final Judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s Complaint. , \n",

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged global food processor Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM) for failing to prevent illicit payments made by foreign subsidiaries to Ukrainian government officials in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)., \n",
       ", An SEC investigation found that ADM's subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine paid $21 million in bribes through intermediaries to secure the release of value-added tax (VAT) refunds. The payments were then concealed by improperly recording the transactions in accounting records as insurance premiums and other purported business expenses. ADM had insufficient anti-bribery compliance controls and made approximately $33 million in illegal profits as a result of the bribery by its subsidiaries., \n",
       ", ADM, which is based in Decatur, Ill., has agreed to pay more than $36 million to settle the SEC's charges. In a parallel action, the U.S. Department of Justice today announced a non-prosecution agreement with ADM and criminal charges against an ADM subsidiary that has agreed to pay $17.8 million in criminal fines., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, the bribery occurred from 2002 to 2008. Ukraine imposed a 20 percent VAT on goods purchased in its country. If the goods were exported, the exporter could apply for a refund of the VAT already paid to the government on those goods. However, at times the Ukrainian government delayed paying VAT refunds it owed or did not make any refund payments at all. On these occasions, the outstanding amount of VAT refunds owed to ADM's Ukraine affiliate reached as high as $46 million., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that in order to obtain the VAT refunds that the Ukraine government was withholding, ADM's subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine devised several schemes to bribe Ukraine government officials to release the money. The bribes paid were generally 18 to 20 percent of the corresponding VAT refunds. For example, the subsidiaries artificially inflated commodities contracts with a Ukrainian shipping company to provide bribe payments to government officials. In another scheme, the subsidiaries created phony insurance contracts with an insurance company that included false premiums passed on to Ukraine government officials. The misconduct went unchecked by ADM for several years because of its deficient and decentralized system of FCPA oversight over subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges ADM with violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. ADM consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering the company to pay disgorgement of $33,342,012 plus prejudgment interest of $3,125,354. The final judgment also permanently enjoins ADM from violating those sections of the Exchange Act, and requires the company to report on its FCPA compliance efforts for a three-year period. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC took into account ADM's cooperation and significant remedial measures, including self-reporting the matter, implementing a comprehensive new compliance program throughout its operations, and terminating employees involved in the misconduct., \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ",  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on December 23, 2013, it charged David F. Marchand, of Campbell, California, a former Board Assistant to the Co-Chief Executive Officer of SAP AG, with unlawful insider trading in the securities of three issuers:  SuccessFactors, Inc. (“SuccessFactors”), Ariba, Inc. (“Ariba”) and SAP AG (“SAP”). According to the SEC’s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, Marchand made a total of $43,500 in illicit profits through his trading. , \n",
       ",  The SEC’s complaint alleges that, while in possession of material nonpublic information concerning SAP’s intention to acquire SuccessFactors, Marchand purchased SuccessFactors common stock between November 21, 2011 and November 28, 2011, in advance of the December 3, 2011 public announcement that SAP and SuccessFactors had entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which a subsidiary of SAP would acquire SuccessFactors for $40 per share in a tender offer.  The price of SuccessFactors common stock increased 51.4 percent after the announcement, and Marchand sold his shares, realizing illicit profits of $28,061. , \n",
       ",  The complaint further alleges that, in early January 2012, Marchand became aware of material nonpublic information regarding SAP’s favorable financial performance for the fourth quarter and year ended 2011, including its “best ever” software revenue numbers.  After learning this information, Marchand purchased SAP American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) prior to SAP’s January 13, 2012 public release of its preliminary fourth quarter 2011 results.  Marchand sold his SAP ADRs after the announcement, realizing illicit profits of $2,157. , \n",
       ",  The SEC also alleges that, a few months later, after he learned material nonpublic information about SAP’s intentions to acquire Ariba, Marchand purchased Ariba common stock on April 16, 2012, May 2, 2012 and May 8, 2012, in advance of the May 22, 2012 public announcement that a subsidiary of SAP and Ariba had entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which a subsidiary of SAP would acquire Ariba for $45 per share of common stock.  The price of Ariba common stock increased approximately 19 percent after the announcement, and Marchand sold his Ariba shares, realizing illegal profits of $13,282. , \n",
       ",  Marchand has consented, without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder; requiring him to pay $43,500 in disgorgement, $2,155 in prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $43,500.  The settlement is subject to court approval. , \n",

       ", SEC Charges Woman and Stepson for Involvment in Zeekrewards Pyramid and Ponzi Scheme; Parallel Criminal Charges and Plea Agreements Also Announced, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", On December 20, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina against Dawn Wright-Olivares and Daniel Olivares for their roles in perpetrating the fraudulent unregistered offer and sale of securities through Rex Venture Group LLC d/b/a ZeekRewards.com, an internet-based combined Ponzi and pyramid scheme. According to the Complaint, from approximately January 2011 until August 2012 when the ZeekRewards website was shut down, Rex Venture Group raised more than $850 million from approximately one million internet customers nationwide and overseas through the website. Both defendants have agreed to settle the Commission’s allegations against them, and their settlement papers were submitted to the Court for its consideration., \n",
       ", The Complaint alleged that defendants solicited investors through the internet and other means to participate in the ZeekRewards program, a self-described “affiliate advertising division” for the companion website, Zeekler.com, through which the defendants operated penny auctions. The ZeekRewards program offered customers several ways to earn money, two of which — the “Retail Profit Pool” and the “Matrix” — involved purchasing securities in the form of investment contracts. These securities offerings were not registered with the SEC as required under the federal securities laws. , \n",
       ", According to the Complaint, Wright-Olivares and others lured investors to ZeekRewards by promising investors a share of the company’s daily net profits in the form of daily profit share awards. The company’s purported calculations consistently resulted in daily award averaging approximately 1.5 percent per day, fraudulently conveying the false impression that the company was extremely profitable. In fact, the daily award percentage was fabricated and investor payouts bore no relation to the company’s net profits. Approximately 98% of ZeekRewards’ total revenues and the “net profits” paid to investors were comprised of funds received from new investors in classic Ponzi scheme fashion. When the company was shut down in August 2012, it was teetering on collapse. , \n",
       ", The Complaint further alleged that Wright-Olivares conceived of the idea for operating penny auctions, helped develop the technical specifications for the Zeekler.com program and its key features, marketed ZeekRewards to investors, managed some of RVG’s operations, and helped design and implement features that concealed the fraud. She was a principal spokesperson for ZeekRewards, and she also served as chief operating officer from September 2011 to June 2012. For the duration of the company’s existence, Olivares was the chief architect of the company’s computer databases that tracked all investments (including subscription and bid purchases), managed the electronic operations, and perpetuated the illusion of a successful retail business. , \n",
       ", The Commission alleged that Wright-Olivares offered and sold securities in violation of the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act, and both defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the Section 17 of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Complaint requested permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants. Without denying the allegations—and while also admitting the facts set forth in the Factual Summary filed contemporaneously with their respective plea agreements in the parallel criminal case — both defendants have agreed to settle the Commission’s charges against them, and their settlement papers were submitted to the Court for its consideration. In particular, both consented to permanent injunctions against future violations of the respective registration and antifraud provisions with which they were each charged. Wright-Olivares also agreed to disgorge at least $8,184,064.94 and Olivares agreed to disgorge at least $3,272,934.58 — amounts that represent the entirety of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest. In light of their anticipated incarceration, no civil penalty will be imposed. The settlements are subject to approval by the court. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of North Carolina simultaneously announced criminal charges against, and plea agreements by, the pair. , \n",

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on December 20, 2013 it obtained a final judgment against Yonghui Zhang, the remaining defendant in an insider trading case involving the securities of Beijing-based Global Education and Technology Group, Ltd.  The case, which was originally filed in the U.S. District Court in Chicago on December 5, 2011, charged eight defendants, including Zhang, with insider trading after they reaped more than $2.8 million in profits by trading in advance of a publicly announced merger between Global Education and London-based Pearson plc.  , \n",
       ", The SEC’s first amended complaint, filed on December 13, 2011, alleged that Yonghui Zhang, a Global Education employee and brother of David Zhang, CEO of Global Education, purchased 7,900 shares of Global Education on the last trading day before the merger announcement.  The first amended complaint also alleged that Pearson and Global Education each announced before trading began on November 21, 2011 that Pearson agreed to acquire all of Global Education’s outstanding stock for $294 million. Global Education’s stock price increased 97 percent that day, from $5.37 to $10.60.  The SEC alleged that Zhang profited by more than $40,000 from his illegal trading.  , \n",
       ", Zhang consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering Zhang to pay disgorgement of $40,494, and ordering a civil penalty against Zhang in the amount of $40,494.

       ", Securities and Exchange Commission v. Mark A. Lefkowitz, et al., , Civil Action No. 8:12-CV-1210, \n",
       ", SEC Settles Civil Action Against Advanced Cell Technology, Inc. Concerning Its Illegal Unregistered Distributions of Stock - Relief Includes Payment of More Than $4 Million, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ",  The Commission today settled a pending civil action against Advanced Cell Technology, Inc. (“Advanced Cell”), arising out of Advanced Cell’s issuance of hundreds of millions of unregistered shares of common stock on thirteen separate occasions without qualifying for any exemption from registration.  The settlement, which was filed with the Court earlier today, is subject to the Court’s approval.  , \n",
       ",  In its Complaint filed on May 30, 2012, the Commission alleged that seven defendants, including Advanced Cell, a biotechnology company with headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts, violated the federal securities laws by engaging in the illegal unregistered distribution of billions of shares of penny stocks through the repeated misuse of the exemption from registration contained in Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Section 3(a)(10) permits a company to issue common stock to public investors other than pursuant to an effective registration statement “in exchange for one or more bona fide outstanding securities, claims or property interests  . . . where the terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange are approved after a hearing [held before a court or other governmental authority authorized to conduct such hearings] upon the fairness of such terms and conditions.”  The Section 3(a)(10) exemption may not be relied upon for capital formation by issuers, and it was improperly used for that purpose in these transactions.   , \n",
       ",  According to the Commission’s Complaint, in or about early 2006, Mark A. Lefkowitz, a penny stock financier, developed an illegal strategy for penny stock issuers to pay off past due debts and also raise capital by issuing stock purportedly pursuant to the Section 3(a)(10) exemption.  The Complaint alleges that in September 2008, Lefkowitz introduced the strategy to William Caldwell IV, who was then the Chief Executive Officer of Advanced Cell.   , \n",
       ",  The Complaint alleges that from September 2008 through January 2009, pursuant to an agreement between Lefkowitz and Caldwell, several entities affiliated with Lefkowitz (collectively, the “Lefkowitz Related Entities”) purchased past due debts of Advanced Cell from various Advanced Cell debtholders.  Shortly after a Lefkowitz Related Entity acquired each debt, Lefkowitz and Caldwell agreed on the terms of a settlement, and the Lefkowitz Related Entity filed a lawsuit against Advanced Cell in a Florida state court purportedly to collect on the debt.  The principal purpose of the lawsuits, according to the Complaint, was to present the settlements to the Florida state court for a fairness hearing, as required by Section 3(a)(10).     , \n",
       ",  The Complaint alleges that, in each instance, the Florida state court found the settlements to be fair and entered an order granting a Section 3(a)(10) exemption.  However, the Commission’s Complaint asserts that the parties never informed the Florida state court of the full terms and conditions of the settlements, thereby compromising the fairness hearings.  According to the Complaint, the parties falsely represented to the Florida state court that they were settling for the face value of the past due debts and did not inform the Florida state court of the actual market value of the settlement shares or that the market value of the shares greatly exceeded the amount of the debts that were to be extinguished.  Nor was the Florida state court told that the Lefkowitz Related Entities had agreed to sell the settlement shares quickly and remit a substantial portion of the sales proceeds to Advanced Cell.  , \n",
       ",  According to the Complaint, Advanced Cell ultimately issued a total of 260,115,983 shares of unrestricted common stock to settle the thirteen lawsuits filed against it by the Lefkowitz Related Entities.  The settlement shares, which had a total market value of approximately $9,230,000 as of the respective settlement dates, were issued to satisfy past due debts totaling approximately $1,110,000.  According to the Complaint, after retaining a portion of the profits from the sale of the shares for themselves, the Lefkowitz Related Entities remitted $3.5 million to Advanced Cell.   , \n",
       ",  The Complaint alleges that, as a result of the foregoing, Advanced Cell’s unregistered distributions to the Lefkowitz Related Entities violated Section 5 of the Securities Act.  The Complaint also alleges that Advanced Cell failed to timely disclose the settlement agreements and its issuance of unregistered shares of common stock in connection with the Section 3(a)(10) settlements by filing current reports on Forms 8-K with the Commission.   , \n",
       ",  The proposed final judgment would enjoin Advanced Cell from violating Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13a-11 thereunder.  It would also order Advanced Cell to disgorge $3.5 million in ill-gotten payments from the Lefkowitz Related Entities, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $586,619, for a total of $4,086,619, but would not impose a civil penalty based upon Advanced Cell’s financial condition.  Advanced Cell consented to the entry of the proposed Final Judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s Complaint. , \n",
       ",  The Commission’s litigation against the five remaining defendants, Mark A. Lefkowitz, Mark A. Lopez, Unico, Inc., Steven R. Peacock, and Shane H. Traveller, is ongoing. , \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged global food processor Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM) for failing to prevent illicit payments made by foreign subsidiaries to Ukrainian government officials in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)., \n",
       ", An SEC investigation found that ADM's subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine paid $21 million in bribes through intermediaries to secure the release of value-added tax (VAT) refunds. The payments were then concealed by improperly recording the transactions in accounting records as insurance premiums and other purported business expenses. ADM had insufficient anti-bribery compliance controls and made approximately $33 million in illegal profits as a result of the bribery by its subsidiaries., \n",
       ", ADM, which is based in Decatur, Ill., has agreed to pay more than $36 million to settle the SEC's charges. In a parallel action, the U.S. Department of Justice today announced a non-prosecution agreement with ADM and criminal charges against an ADM subsidiary that has agreed to pay $17.8 million in criminal fines., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, the bribery occurred from 2002 to 2008. Ukraine imposed a 20 percent VAT on goods purchased in its country. If the goods were exported, the exporter could apply for a refund of the VAT already paid to the government on those goods. However, at times the Ukrainian government delayed paying VAT refunds it owed or did not make any refund payments at all. On these occasions, the outstanding amount of VAT refunds owed to ADM's Ukraine affiliate reached as high as $46 million., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that in order to obtain the VAT refunds that the Ukraine government was withholding, ADM's subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine devised several schemes to bribe Ukraine government officials to release the money. The bribes paid were generally 18 to 20 percent of the corresponding VAT refunds. For example, the subsidiaries artificially inflated commodities contracts with a Ukrainian shipping company to provide bribe payments to government officials. In another scheme, the subsidiaries created phony insurance contracts with an insurance company that included false premiums passed on to Ukraine government officials. The misconduct went unchecked by ADM for several years because of its deficient and decentralized system of FCPA oversight over subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges ADM with violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. ADM consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering the company to pay disgorgement of $33,342,012 plus prejudgment interest of $3,125,354. The final judgment also permanently enjoins ADM from violating those sections of the Exchange Act, and requires the company to report on its FCPA compliance efforts for a three-year period. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC took into account ADM's cooperation and significant remedial measures, including self-reporting the matter, implementing a comprehensive new compliance program throughout its operations, and terminating employees involved in the misconduct., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Nicholas A. Brady and supervised by Moira T. Roberts and Anita B. Bandy. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Justice Department's Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation., \n",

       ",  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on December 23, 2013, it charged David F. Marchand, of Campbell, California, a former Board Assistant to the Co-Chief Executive Officer of SAP AG, with unlawful insider trading in the securities of three issuers:  SuccessFactors, Inc. (“SuccessFactors”), Ariba, Inc. (“Ariba”) and SAP AG (“SAP”). According to the SEC’s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, Marchand made a total of $43,500 in illicit profits through his trading. , \n",
       ",  The SEC’s complaint alleges that, while in possession of material nonpublic information concerning SAP’s intention to acquire SuccessFactors, Marchand purchased SuccessFactors common stock between November 21, 2011 and November 28, 2011, in advance of the December 3, 2011 public announcement that SAP and SuccessFactors had entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which a subsidiary of SAP would acquire SuccessFactors for $40 per share in a tender offer.  The price of SuccessFactors common stock increased 51.4 percent after the announcement, and Marchand sold his shares, realizing illicit profits of $28,061. , \n",
       ",  The complaint further alleges that, in early January 2012, Marchand became aware of material nonpublic information regarding SAP’s favorable financial performance for the fourth quarter and year ended 2011, including its “best ever” software revenue numbers.  After learning this information, Marchand purchased SAP American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) prior to SAP’s January 13, 2012 public release of its preliminary fourth quarter 2011 results.  Marchand sold his SAP ADRs after the announcement, realizing illicit profits of $2,157. , \n",
       ",  The SEC also alleges that, a few months later, after he learned material nonpublic information about SAP’s intentions to acquire Ariba, Marchand purchased Ariba common stock on April 16, 2012, May 2, 2012 and May 8, 2012, in advance of the May 22, 2012 public announcement that a subsidiary of SAP and Ariba had entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which a subsidiary of SAP would acquire Ariba for $45 per share of common stock.  The price of Ariba common stock increased approximately 19 percent after the announcement, and Marchand sold his Ariba shares, realizing illegal profits of $13,282. , \n",
       ",  Marchand has consented, without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder; requiring him to pay $43,500 in disgorgement, $2,155 in prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $43,500.

       ", SEC Charges Woman and Stepson for Involvment in Zeekrewards Pyramid and Ponzi Scheme; Parallel Criminal Charges and Plea Agreements Also Announced, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", On December 20, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina against Dawn Wright-Olivares and Daniel Olivares for their roles in perpetrating the fraudulent unregistered offer and sale of securities through Rex Venture Group LLC d/b/a ZeekRewards.com, an internet-based combined Ponzi and pyramid scheme. According to the Complaint, from approximately January 2011 until August 2012 when the ZeekRewards website was shut down, Rex Venture Group raised more than $850 million from approximately one million internet customers nationwide and overseas through the website. Both defendants have agreed to settle the Commission’s allegations against them, and their settlement papers were submitted to the Court for its consideration., \n",
       ", The Complaint alleged that defendants solicited investors through the internet and other means to participate in the ZeekRewards program, a self-described “affiliate advertising division” for the companion website, Zeekler.com, through which the defendants operated penny auctions. The ZeekRewards program offered customers several ways to earn money, two of which — the “Retail Profit Pool” and the “Matrix” — involved purchasing securities in the form of investment contracts. These securities offerings were not registered with the SEC as required under the federal securities laws. , \n",
       ", According to the Complaint, Wright-Olivares and others lured investors to ZeekRewards by promising investors a share of the company’s daily net profits in the form of daily profit share awards. The company’s purported calculations consistently resulted in daily award averaging approximately 1.5 percent per day, fraudulently conveying the false impression that the company was extremely profitable. In fact, the daily award percentage was fabricated and investor payouts bore no relation to the company’s net profits. Approximately 98% of ZeekRewards’ total revenues and the “net profits” paid to investors were comprised of funds received from new investors in classic Ponzi scheme fashion. When the company was shut down in August 2012, it was teetering on collapse. , \n",
       ", The Complaint further alleged that Wright-Olivares conceived of the idea for operating penny auctions, helped develop the technical specifications for the Zeekler.com program and its key features, marketed ZeekRewards to investors, managed some of RVG’s operations, and helped design and implement features that concealed the fraud. She was a principal spokesperson for ZeekRewards, and she also served as chief operating officer from September 2011 to June 2012. For the duration of the company’s existence, Olivares was the chief architect of the company’s computer databases that tracked all investments (including subscription and bid purchases), managed the electronic operations, and perpetuated the illusion of a successful retail business. , \n",
       ", The Commission alleged that Wright-Olivares offered and sold securities in violation of the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act, and both defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the Section 17 of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Complaint requested permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants. Without denying the allegations—and while also admitting the facts set forth in the Factual Summary filed contemporaneously with their respective plea agreements in the parallel criminal case — both defendants have agreed to settle the Commission’s charges against them, and their settlement papers were submitted to the Court for its consideration. In particular, both consented to permanent injunctions against future violations of the respective registration and antifraud provisions with which they were each charged. Wright-Olivares also agreed to disgorge at least $8,184,064.94 and Olivares agreed to disgorge at least $3,272,934.58 — amounts that represent the entirety of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest. In light of their anticipated incarceration, no civil penalty will be imposed. The settlements are subject to approval by the court. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of North Carolina simultaneously announced criminal charges against, and plea agreements by, the pair. , \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on December 20, 2013 it obtained a final judgment against Yonghui Zhang, the remaining defendant in an insider trading case involving the securities of Beijing-based Global Education and Technology Group, Ltd.  The case, which was originally filed in the U.S. District Court in Chicago on December 5, 2011, charged eight defendants, including Zhang, with insider trading after they reaped more than $2.8 million in profits by trading in advance of a publicly announced merger between Global Education and London-based Pearson plc.  , \n",
       ", The SEC’s first amended complaint, filed on December 13, 2011, alleged that Yonghui Zhang, a Global Education employee and brother of David Zhang, CEO of Global Education, purchased 7,900 shares of Global Education on the last trading day before the merger announcement.  The first amended complaint also alleged that Pearson and Global Education each announced before trading began on November 21, 2011 that Pearson agreed to acquire all of Global Education’s outstanding stock for $294 million. Global Education’s stock price increased 97 percent that day, from $5.37 to $10.60.  The SEC alleged that Zhang profited by more than $40,000 from his illegal trading.  , \n",
       ", Zhang consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering Zhang to pay disgorgement of $40,494, and ordering a civil penalty against Zhang in the amount of $40,494.

       ", SEC Settles Civil Action Against Advanced Cell Technology, Inc. Concerning Its Illegal Unregistered Distributions of Stock - Relief Includes Payment of More Than $4 Million, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ",  The Commission today settled a pending civil action against Advanced Cell Technology, Inc. (“Advanced Cell”), arising out of Advanced Cell’s issuance of hundreds of millions of unregistered shares of common stock on thirteen separate occasions without qualifying for any exemption from registration.  The settlement, which was filed with the Court earlier today, is subject to the Court’s approval.  , \n",
       ",  In its Complaint filed on May 30, 2012, the Commission alleged that seven defendants, including Advanced Cell, a biotechnology company with headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts, violated the federal securities laws by engaging in the illegal unregistered distribution of billions of shares of penny stocks through the repeated misuse of the exemption from registration contained in Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Section 3(a)(10) permits a company to issue common stock to public investors other than pursuant to an effective registration statement “in exchange for one or more bona fide outstanding securities, claims or property interests  . . . where the terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange are approved after a hearing [held before a court or other governmental authority authorized to conduct such hearings] upon the fairness of such terms and conditions.”  The Section 3(a)(10) exemption may not be relied upon for capital formation by issuers, and it was improperly used for that purpose in these transactions.   , \n",
       ",  According to the Commission’s Complaint, in or about early 2006, Mark A. Lefkowitz, a penny stock financier, developed an illegal strategy for penny stock issuers to pay off past due debts and also raise capital by issuing stock purportedly pursuant to the Section 3(a)(10) exemption.  The Complaint alleges that in September 2008, Lefkowitz introduced the strategy to William Caldwell IV, who was then the Chief Executive Officer of Advanced Cell.   , \n",
       ",  The Complaint alleges that from September 2008 through January 2009, pursuant to an agreement between Lefkowitz and Caldwell, several entities affiliated with Lefkowitz (collectively, the “Lefkowitz Related Entities”) purchased past due debts of Advanced Cell from various Advanced Cell debtholders.  Shortly after a Lefkowitz Related Entity acquired each debt, Lefkowitz and Caldwell agreed on the terms of a settlement, and the Lefkowitz Related Entity filed a lawsuit against Advanced Cell in a Florida state court purportedly to collect on the debt.  The principal purpose of the lawsuits, according to the Complaint, was to present the settlements to the Florida state court for a fairness hearing, as required by Section 3(a)(10).     , \n",
       ",  The Complaint alleges that, in each instance, the Florida state court found the settlements to be fair and entered an order granting a Section 3(a)(10) exemption.  However, the Commission’s Complaint asserts that the parties never informed the Florida state court of the full terms and conditions of the settlements, thereby compromising the fairness hearings.  According to the Complaint, the parties falsely represented to the Florida state court that they were settling for the face value of the past due debts and did not inform the Florida state court of the actual market value of the settlement shares or that the market value of the shares greatly exceeded the amount of the debts that were to be extinguished.  Nor was the Florida state court told that the Lefkowitz Related Entities had agreed to sell the settlement shares quickly and remit a substantial portion of the sales proceeds to Advanced Cell.  , \n",
       ",  According to the Complaint, Advanced Cell ultimately issued a total of 260,115,983 shares of unrestricted common stock to settle the thirteen lawsuits filed against it by the Lefkowitz Related Entities.  The settlement shares, which had a total market value of approximately $9,230,000 as of the respective settlement dates, were issued to satisfy past due debts totaling approximately $1,110,000.  According to the Complaint, after retaining a portion of the profits from the sale of the shares for themselves, the Lefkowitz Related Entities remitted $3.5 million to Advanced Cell.   , \n",
       ",  The Complaint alleges that, as a result of the foregoing, Advanced Cell’s unregistered distributions to the Lefkowitz Related Entities violated Section 5 of the Securities Act.  The Complaint also alleges that Advanced Cell failed to timely disclose the settlement agreements and its issuance of unregistered shares of common stock in connection with the Section 3(a)(10) settlements by filing current reports on Forms 8-K with the Commission.   , \n",
       ",  The proposed final judgment would enjoin Advanced Cell from violating Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13a-11 thereunder.  It would also order Advanced Cell to disgorge $3.5 million in ill-gotten payments from the Lefkowitz Related Entities, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $586,619, for a total of $4,086,619, but would not impose a civil penalty based upon Advanced Cell’s financial condition.  Advanced Cell consented to the entry of the proposed Final Judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s Complaint. , \n",

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged global food processor Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM) for failing to prevent illicit payments made by foreign subsidiaries to Ukrainian government officials in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)., \n",
       ", An SEC investigation found that ADM's subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine paid $21 million in bribes through intermediaries to secure the release of value-added tax (VAT) refunds. The payments were then concealed by improperly recording the transactions in accounting records as insurance premiums and other purported business expenses. ADM had insufficient anti-bribery compliance controls and made approximately $33 million in illegal profits as a result of the bribery by its subsidiaries., \n",
       ", ADM, which is based in Decatur, Ill., has agreed to pay more than $36 million to settle the SEC's charges. In a parallel action, the U.S. Department of Justice today announced a non-prosecution agreement with ADM and criminal charges against an ADM subsidiary that has agreed to pay $17.8 million in criminal fines., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, the bribery occurred from 2002 to 2008. Ukraine imposed a 20 percent VAT on goods purchased in its country. If the goods were exported, the exporter could apply for a refund of the VAT already paid to the government on those goods. However, at times the Ukrainian government delayed paying VAT refunds it owed or did not make any refund payments at all. On these occasions, the outstanding amount of VAT refunds owed to ADM's Ukraine affiliate reached as high as $46 million., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that in order to obtain the VAT refunds that the Ukraine government was withholding, ADM's subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine devised several schemes to bribe Ukraine government officials to release the money. The bribes paid were generally 18 to 20 percent of the corresponding VAT refunds. For example, the subsidiaries artificially inflated commodities contracts with a Ukrainian shipping company to provide bribe payments to government officials. In another scheme, the subsidiaries created phony insurance contracts with an insurance company that included false premiums passed on to Ukraine government officials. The misconduct went unchecked by ADM for several years because of its deficient and decentralized system of FCPA oversight over subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges ADM with violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. ADM consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering the company to pay disgorgement of $33,342,012 plus prejudgment interest of $3,125,354. The final judgment also permanently enjoins ADM from violating those sections of the Exchange Act, and requires the company to report on its FCPA compliance efforts for a three-year period.

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ",  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that, on December 23, 2013, it charged David F. Marchand, of Campbell, California, a former Board Assistant to the Co-Chief Executive Officer of SAP AG, with unlawful insider trading in the securities of three issuers:  SuccessFactors, Inc. (“SuccessFactors”), Ariba, Inc. (“Ariba”) and SAP AG (“SAP”). According to the SEC’s complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, Marchand made a total of $43,500 in illicit profits through his trading. , \n",
       ",  The SEC’s complaint alleges that, while in possession of material nonpublic information concerning SAP’s intention to acquire SuccessFactors, Marchand purchased SuccessFactors common stock between November 21, 2011 and November 28, 2011, in advance of the December 3, 2011 public announcement that SAP and SuccessFactors had entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which a subsidiary of SAP would acquire SuccessFactors for $40 per share in a tender offer.  The price of SuccessFactors common stock increased 51.4 percent after the announcement, and Marchand sold his shares, realizing illicit profits of $28,061. , \n",
       ",  The complaint further alleges that, in early January 2012, Marchand became aware of material nonpublic information regarding SAP’s favorable financial performance for the fourth quarter and year ended 2011, including its “best ever” software revenue numbers.  After learning this information, Marchand purchased SAP American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) prior to SAP’s January 13, 2012 public release of its preliminary fourth quarter 2011 results.  Marchand sold his SAP ADRs after the announcement, realizing illicit profits of $2,157. , \n",
       ",  The SEC also alleges that, a few months later, after he learned material nonpublic information about SAP’s intentions to acquire Ariba, Marchand purchased Ariba common stock on April 16, 2012, May 2, 2012 and May 8, 2012, in advance of the May 22, 2012 public announcement that a subsidiary of SAP and Ariba had entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which a subsidiary of SAP would acquire Ariba for $45 per share of common stock.  The price of Ariba common stock increased approximately 19 percent after the announcement, and Marchand sold his Ariba shares, realizing illegal profits of $13,282. , \n",
       ",  Marchand has consented, without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations, to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder; requiring him to pay $43,500 in disgorgement, $2,155 in prejudgment interest, and a penalty of $43,500.  The settlement is subject to court approval. , \n",

According to the Complaint, from approximately January 2011 until August 2012 when the ZeekRewards website was shut down, Rex Venture Group raised more than $850 million from approximately one million internet customers nationwide and overseas through the website. Both defendants have agreed to settle the Commission’s allegations against them, and their settlement papers were submitted to the Court for its consideration., \n",
       ", The Complaint alleged that defendants solicited investors through the internet and other means to participate in the ZeekRewards program, a self-described “affiliate advertising division” for the companion website, Zeekler.com, through which the defendants operated penny auctions. The ZeekRewards program offered customers several ways to earn money, two of which — the “Retail Profit Pool” and the “Matrix” — involved purchasing securities in the form of investment contracts. These securities offerings were not registered with the SEC as required under the federal securities laws. , \n",
       ", According to the Complaint, Wright-Olivares and others lured investors to ZeekRewards by promising investors a share of the company’s daily net profits in the form of daily profit share awards. The company’s purported calculations consistently resulted in daily award averaging approximately 1.5 percent per day, fraudulently conveying the false impression that the company was extremely profitable. In fact, the daily award percentage was fabricated and investor payouts bore no relation to the company’s net profits. Approximately 98% of ZeekRewards’ total revenues and the “net profits” paid to investors were comprised of funds received from new investors in classic Ponzi scheme fashion. When the company was shut down in August 2012, it was teetering on collapse. , \n",
       ", The Complaint further alleged that Wright-Olivares conceived of the idea for operating penny auctions, helped develop the technical specifications for the Zeekler.com program and its key features, marketed ZeekRewards to investors, managed some of RVG’s operations, and helped design and implement features that concealed the fraud. She was a principal spokesperson for ZeekRewards, and she also served as chief operating officer from September 2011 to June 2012. For the duration of the company’s existence, Olivares was the chief architect of the company’s computer databases that tracked all investments (including subscription and bid purchases), managed the electronic operations, and perpetuated the illusion of a successful retail business. , \n",
       ", The Commission alleged that Wright-Olivares offered and sold securities in violation of the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act, and both defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the Section 17 of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Complaint requested permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants. Without denying the allegations—and while also admitting the facts set forth in the Factual Summary filed contemporaneously with their respective plea agreements in the parallel criminal case — both defendants have agreed to settle the Commission’s charges against them, and their settlement papers were submitted to the Court for its consideration. In particular, both consented to permanent injunctions against future violations of the respective registration and antifraud provisions with which they were each charged. Wright-Olivares also agreed to disgorge at least $8,184,064.94 and Olivares agreed to disgorge at least $3,272,934.58 — amounts that represent the entirety of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest. In light of their anticipated incarceration, no civil penalty will be imposed. The settlements are subject to approval by the court. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of North Carolina simultaneously announced criminal charges against, and plea agreements by, the pair. , \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on December 20, 2013 it obtained a final judgment against Yonghui Zhang, the remaining defendant in an insider trading case involving the securities of Beijing-based Global Education and Technology Group, Ltd.  The case, which was originally filed in the U.S. District Court in Chicago on December 5, 2011, charged eight defendants, including Zhang, with insider trading after they reaped more than $2.8 million in profits by trading in advance of a publicly announced merger between Global Education and London-based Pearson plc.  , \n",
       ", The SEC’s first amended complaint, filed on December 13, 2011, alleged that Yonghui Zhang, a Global Education employee and brother of David Zhang, CEO of Global Education, purchased 7,900 shares of Global Education on the last trading day before the merger announcement.  The first amended complaint also alleged that Pearson and Global Education each announced before trading began on November 21, 2011 that Pearson agreed to acquire all of Global Education’s outstanding stock for $294 million. Global Education’s stock price increased 97 percent that day, from $5.37 to $10.60.  The SEC alleged that Zhang profited by more than $40,000 from his illegal trading.  , \n",
       ", Zhang consented to the entry of a final judgment enjoining him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering Zhang to pay disgorgement of $40,494, and ordering a civil penalty against Zhang in the amount of $40,494.  The relief obtained concludes the litigation in , SEC v. All Know Holdings Ltd, et al, ., \n",

       ", SEC Settles Civil Action Against Advanced Cell Technology, Inc. Concerning Its Illegal Unregistered Distributions of Stock - Relief Includes Payment of More Than $4 Million, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ",  The Commission today settled a pending civil action against Advanced Cell Technology, Inc. (“Advanced Cell”), arising out of Advanced Cell’s issuance of hundreds of millions of unregistered shares of common stock on thirteen separate occasions without qualifying for any exemption from registration.  The settlement, which was filed with the Court earlier today, is subject to the Court’s approval.  , \n",
       ",  In its Complaint filed on May 30, 2012, the Commission alleged that seven defendants, including Advanced Cell, a biotechnology company with headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts, violated the federal securities laws by engaging in the illegal unregistered distribution of billions of shares of penny stocks through the repeated misuse of the exemption from registration contained in Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Section 3(a)(10) permits a company to issue common stock to public investors other than pursuant to an effective registration statement “in exchange for one or more bona fide outstanding securities, claims or property interests  . . . where the terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange are approved after a hearing [held before a court or other governmental authority authorized to conduct such hearings] upon the fairness of such terms and conditions.”  The Section 3(a)(10) exemption may not be relied upon for capital formation by issuers, and it was improperly used for that purpose in these transactions.   , \n",
       ",  According to the Commission’s Complaint, in or about early 2006, Mark A. Lefkowitz, a penny stock financier, developed an illegal strategy for penny stock issuers to pay off past due debts and also raise capital by issuing stock purportedly pursuant to the Section 3(a)(10) exemption.  The Complaint alleges that in September 2008, Lefkowitz introduced the strategy to William Caldwell IV, who was then the Chief Executive Officer of Advanced Cell.   , \n",
       ",  The Complaint alleges that from September 2008 through January 2009, pursuant to an agreement between Lefkowitz and Caldwell, several entities affiliated with Lefkowitz (collectively, the “Lefkowitz Related Entities”) purchased past due debts of Advanced Cell from various Advanced Cell debtholders.  Shortly after a Lefkowitz Related Entity acquired each debt, Lefkowitz and Caldwell agreed on the terms of a settlement, and the Lefkowitz Related Entity filed a lawsuit against Advanced Cell in a Florida state court purportedly to collect on the debt.  The principal purpose of the lawsuits, according to the Complaint, was to present the settlements to the Florida state court for a fairness hearing, as required by Section 3(a)(10).     , \n",
       ",  The Complaint alleges that, in each instance, the Florida state court found the settlements to be fair and entered an order granting a Section 3(a)(10) exemption.  However, the Commission’s Complaint asserts that the parties never informed the Florida state court of the full terms and conditions of the settlements, thereby compromising the fairness hearings.  According to the Complaint, the parties falsely represented to the Florida state court that they were settling for the face value of the past due debts and did not inform the Florida state court of the actual market value of the settlement shares or that the market value of the shares greatly exceeded the amount of the debts that were to be extinguished.  Nor was the Florida state court told that the Lefkowitz Related Entities had agreed to sell the settlement shares quickly and remit a substantial portion of the sales proceeds to Advanced Cell.  , \n",
       ",  According to the Complaint, Advanced Cell ultimately issued a total of 260,115,983 shares of unrestricted common stock to settle the thirteen lawsuits filed against it by the Lefkowitz Related Entities.  The settlement shares, which had a total market value of approximately $9,230,000 as of the respective settlement dates, were issued to satisfy past due debts totaling approximately $1,110,000.  According to the Complaint, after retaining a portion of the profits from the sale of the shares for themselves, the Lefkowitz Related Entities remitted $3.5 million to Advanced Cell.   , \n",
       ",  The Complaint alleges that, as a result of the foregoing, Advanced Cell’s unregistered distributions to the Lefkowitz Related Entities violated Section 5 of the Securities Act.  The Complaint also alleges that Advanced Cell failed to timely disclose the settlement agreements and its issuance of unregistered shares of common stock in connection with the Section 3(a)(10) settlements by filing current reports on Forms 8-K with the Commission.   , \n",
       ",  The proposed final judgment would enjoin Advanced Cell from violating Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13a-11 thereunder.  It would also order Advanced Cell to disgorge $3.5 million in ill-gotten payments from the Lefkowitz Related Entities, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $586,619, for a total of $4,086,619, but would not impose a civil penalty based upon Advanced Cell’s financial condition.  Advanced Cell consented to the entry of the proposed Final Judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission’s Complaint. , \n",
       ",  The Commission’s litigation against the five remaining defendants, Mark A. Lefkowitz, Mark A. Lopez, Unico, Inc., Steven R. Peacock, and Shane H. Traveller, is ongoing. , \n",
