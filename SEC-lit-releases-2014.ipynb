       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", On December 23, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a stock promoter based in Santa Barbara, Calif., with fraudulently raising nearly $3.5 million from investors purportedly to purchase Facebook and Twitter shares prior to their initial public offerings (IPOs)., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that instead of purchasing the shares in the secondary market as promised, Efstratios \"Elias\" Argyropoulos and his firm Prima Capital Group misappropriated investor funds.  They used the money primarily for day trading of stocks and options as well as to pay off certain investors who complained when they didn't receive the promised Facebook or Twitter shares., \n",
       ", Argyropoulos and Prima Capital agreed to settle the SEC's charges and to be barred from working for an investment adviser or broker-dealer, and financial penalties will be determined at a later date., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleges that Argyropoulos and Prima violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and, against Argyropoulos only, civil money penalties.  , \n",
       ", Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Argyropoulos and Prima consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering them to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and ordering Argyropoulos to pay civil money penalties.  There will be further proceedings before the District Court to determine the amounts of disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil money penalties.  The bifurcated settlement remains subject to court approval.  Argyropoulos also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, to an administrative proceeding order barring him from, among other things, association with any broker, dealer or investment adviser.  The administrative proceeding will be instituted following court approval of the bifurcated settlement., \n",
       ", Also on December 23, 2014, SEC separately announced an administrative proceeding against Khaled A. Eldaher, a registered representative living in Austin, Texas.  The SEC Enforcement Division alleges that while working for a registered broker-dealer, Eldaher reached a side agreement with Argyropoulos to solicit investors and receive 50 percent of the mark-up on Facebook shares he sold.  Eldaher sold $362,887.50 worth of Facebook shares and was paid $15,478 by Prima Capital.  He was later terminated by the broker-dealer for selling securities other than through the firm.  The Enforcement Division alleges that Eldaher's sales of unregistered securities violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  The matter will be scheduled for a public hearing before an administrative law judge for proceedings to adjudicate the Enforcement Division's allegations and determine what, if any, remedial actions are appropriate., \n",

Grewal sold his entire investment in Spectrum stock within 48 hours of getting the nonpublic information from company officials who sought the disclosure advice of his law firm.  He tipped his wife Preetinder Grewal, who also sold all of her Spectrum shares on the basis of the nonpublic information.  The day after Grewal sold her stock, Spectrum issued a press release revealing the expectation of decreased sales of the drug Fusilev and the consequent expectation of reduced revenue, and Spectrum's stock price fell more than 35 percent.  Shivbir Grewal and his wife avoided losses of nearly $45,000 by selling ahead of the bad news., \n",

Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Grewals agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions of the securities laws.  Shivbir Grewal agreed to pay disgorgement of $30,343.17, prejudgment interest of $997.68, and a penalty of $30,343.17.

       ", Securities and Exchange Commission v. Howard B. Present, , Civil Action No. 14-CV-14692 (District of Massachusetts, filed December 22, 2014), \n",
       ", SEC Charges Investment Manager F-Squared and Former CEO with Making False Performance Claims, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") today announced that investment management firm F-Squared Investments has agreed to pay $35 million and admit wrongdoing to settle charges that it defrauded investors through false performance advertising about its flagship product., \n",
       ", The SEC separately charged the firm's co-founder and former CEO Howard Present with making false and misleading statements to investors as the public face of F-Squared., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against Massachusetts-based F-Squared, which is the largest marketer of index products using exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the firm began receiving signals from a third-party data provider in September 2008 indicating when to buy or sell an investment.  The signals were based on an algorithm, and F-Squared and Present used the signals to create a model portfolio of sector ETFs that could be rebalanced periodically as the signals changed.  They named the new product \"AlphaSector\" and launched the first index a month later.  AlphaSector's indexes quickly became the firm's largest revenue source, and F-Squared went from losing money to becoming a highly profitable investment manager., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that while marketing AlphaSector into the largest active ETF strategy in the market, F-Squared falsely advertised a successful seven-year track record for the investment strategy based on the actual performance of real investments for real clients.  In reality, the algorithm was not even in existence during the seven years of purported performance success.  The data used in F-Squared's advertising was actually derived through backtesting, which is the application of a quantitative model to historical market data to generate a hypothetical performance during a prior period.  F-Squared and Present specifically advertised the investment strategy as \"not backtested.\"  Furthermore, the hypothetical data contained a substantial performance calculation error that inflated the results by approximately 350 percent., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint against Present filed in federal court in Boston, he was responsible for F-Squared's advertising materials that were often posted on the company website and sent to clients and prospective clients.  Present also was responsible for the descriptions of AlphaSector in its filings with the SEC, and he certified the accuracy of those filings.  F-Squared and Present made the false and misleading statements about AlphaSector from September 2008 to September 2013.  The SEC alleges that they claimed AlphaSector was based on an investment strategy that had been used to invest client assets since April 2001.  Yet Present knew that the algorithm was not finalized until late summer 2008 when he devised rules for turning the signals into a model ETF portfolio and directed an assistant to calculate hypothetical returns for the portfolio going back to April 2001., \n",
       ", The SEC further alleges that the F-Squared analyst who calculated the backtested AlphaSector performance inadvertently applied the buy/sell signals to the week preceding any ETF price change that the signals were based on.  The mistake carried the model portfolio's backtested buy and sell decisions back in time one week, enabling the model to buy an ETF just before the price rose and sell an ETF just before the price fell.  The SEC alleges that the analyst tried to explain this possible calculation error to Present in late September 2008, yet F-Squared went on to advertise the inflated data for the next five years and overstated that AlphaSector significantly outperformed the S&amp;P; 500 from April 2001 to September 2008., \n",
       ", F-Squared consented to the entry of the order finding that it violated Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), 206(4), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 204-2(a)(16), 206(4)-1(a)(5), 206(4)-7, and 206(4)-8.  The order also finds that F-Squared aided and abetted and caused certain mutual funds sub-advised by F-Squared to violation Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  F-Squared acknowledged that its conduct violated federal securities laws, and agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of these provisions.  F-Squared agreed to retain an independent compliance consultant and pay disgorgement of $30 million and a penalty of $5 million. , \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint against Present alleges that he violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), 206(4), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Bill Donahue, Robert Baker, Jose Santillan, and John Farinacci of the Asset Management Unit as well as Rachel Hershfang, Frank Huntington, Mayeti Gametchu, Jennifer Cardello, and Rory Alex of the Boston Regional Office.

       ", SEC Charges Stock Promoter with Fraudulent Scheme Related to Pre-IPO Facebook and Twitter Shares, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", On December 23, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a stock promoter based in Santa Barbara, Calif., with fraudulently raising nearly $3.5 million from investors purportedly to purchase Facebook and Twitter shares prior to their initial public offerings (IPOs)., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that instead of purchasing the shares in the secondary market as promised, Efstratios \"Elias\" Argyropoulos and his firm Prima Capital Group misappropriated investor funds.  They used the money primarily for day trading of stocks and options as well as to pay off certain investors who complained when they didn't receive the promised Facebook or Twitter shares., \n",
       ", Argyropoulos and Prima Capital agreed to settle the SEC's charges and to be barred from working for an investment adviser or broker-dealer, and financial penalties will be determined at a later date., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleges that Argyropoulos and Prima violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and, against Argyropoulos only, civil money penalties.  , \n",
       ", Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Argyropoulos and Prima consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering them to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and ordering Argyropoulos to pay civil money penalties.  There will be further proceedings before the District Court to determine the amounts of disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil money penalties.  The bifurcated settlement remains subject to court approval.  Argyropoulos also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, to an administrative proceeding order barring him from, among other things, association with any broker, dealer or investment adviser.  The administrative proceeding will be instituted following court approval of the bifurcated settlement., \n",
       ", Also on December 23, 2014, SEC separately announced an administrative proceeding against Khaled A. Eldaher, a registered representative living in Austin, Texas.  The SEC Enforcement Division alleges that while working for a registered broker-dealer, Eldaher reached a side agreement with Argyropoulos to solicit investors and receive 50 percent of the mark-up on Facebook shares he sold.  Eldaher sold $362,887.50 worth of Facebook shares and was paid $15,478 by Prima Capital.  He was later terminated by the broker-dealer for selling securities other than through the firm.  The Enforcement Division alleges that Eldaher's sales of unregistered securities violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  The matter will be scheduled for a public hearing before an administrative law judge for proceedings to adjudicate the Enforcement Division's allegations and determine what, if any, remedial actions are appropriate., \n",

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on December 11, 2014, the Honorable William J. Zloch, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of Florida entered a Final Judgment ordering Defendant Robert B. Cook to pay a $150,000 civil money penalty., \n",

       ", The Commission's complaint, filed on March 19, 2013, alleged that from approximately January 2010 through at least May 2011, E-Monee.com, Inc., its president Estuardo Benavides, and Cook one of its directors, offered shares in E-Monee, while claiming the company owned Mexican bonds purportedly worth billions of dollars, and that E-Monee's shares would substantially increase in value. The complaint alleged that the Mexican bonds were essentially worthless and there was no valid basis for the claims by Benavides and Cook that E-Monee's stock price would increase significantly., \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that while serving as outside counsel to Spectrum Pharmaceuticals last year, Shivbir Grewal learned that the company was on the brink of announcing a significant decline in expected revenue due to an unanticipated drop in orders for its top-selling drug.  Grewal sold his entire investment in Spectrum stock within 48 hours of getting the nonpublic information from company officials who sought the disclosure advice of his law firm.  He tipped his wife Preetinder Grewal, who also sold all of her Spectrum shares on the basis of the nonpublic information.  The day after Grewal sold her stock, Spectrum issued a press release revealing the expectation of decreased sales of the drug Fusilev and the consequent expectation of reduced revenue, and Spectrum's stock price fell more than 35 percent.  Shivbir Grewal and his wife avoided losses of nearly $45,000 by selling ahead of the bad news., \n",
       ", The Grewals agreed to pay $90,000 to settle the SEC's charges, and Shivbir Grewal also agreed to be suspended from practicing as an attorney before the SEC on behalf of any publicly traded company or other entity regulated by the agency., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleges that the Grewals violated Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as well as Rule 10b-5.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Grewals agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions of the securities laws.  Shivbir Grewal agreed to pay disgorgement of $30,343.17, prejudgment interest of $997.68, and a penalty of $30,343.17.  Preetinder Grewal agreed to pay disgorgement of $14,400.05, prejudgment interest of $476.73, and a penalty of $14,400.05.  The settlement is subject to court approval. , \n",

       ", Securities and Exchange Commission v. Howard B. Present, , Civil Action No. 14-CV-14692 (District of Massachusetts, filed December 22, 2014), \n",
       ", SEC Charges Investment Manager F-Squared and Former CEO with Making False Performance Claims, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") today announced that investment management firm F-Squared Investments has agreed to pay $35 million and admit wrongdoing to settle charges that it defrauded investors through false performance advertising about its flagship product., \n",
       ", The SEC separately charged the firm's co-founder and former CEO Howard Present with making false and misleading statements to investors as the public face of F-Squared., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against Massachusetts-based F-Squared, which is the largest marketer of index products using exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the firm began receiving signals from a third-party data provider in September 2008 indicating when to buy or sell an investment.  The signals were based on an algorithm, and F-Squared and Present used the signals to create a model portfolio of sector ETFs that could be rebalanced periodically as the signals changed.  They named the new product \"AlphaSector\" and launched the first index a month later.  AlphaSector's indexes quickly became the firm's largest revenue source, and F-Squared went from losing money to becoming a highly profitable investment manager., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that while marketing AlphaSector into the largest active ETF strategy in the market, F-Squared falsely advertised a successful seven-year track record for the investment strategy based on the actual performance of real investments for real clients.  In reality, the algorithm was not even in existence during the seven years of purported performance success.  The data used in F-Squared's advertising was actually derived through backtesting, which is the application of a quantitative model to historical market data to generate a hypothetical performance during a prior period.  F-Squared and Present specifically advertised the investment strategy as \"not backtested.\"  Furthermore, the hypothetical data contained a substantial performance calculation error that inflated the results by approximately 350 percent., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint against Present filed in federal court in Boston, he was responsible for F-Squared's advertising materials that were often posted on the company website and sent to clients and prospective clients.  Present also was responsible for the descriptions of AlphaSector in its filings with the SEC, and he certified the accuracy of those filings.  F-Squared and Present made the false and misleading statements about AlphaSector from September 2008 to September 2013.  The SEC alleges that they claimed AlphaSector was based on an investment strategy that had been used to invest client assets since April 2001.  Yet Present knew that the algorithm was not finalized until late summer 2008 when he devised rules for turning the signals into a model ETF portfolio and directed an assistant to calculate hypothetical returns for the portfolio going back to April 2001., \n",
       ", The SEC further alleges that the F-Squared analyst who calculated the backtested AlphaSector performance inadvertently applied the buy/sell signals to the week preceding any ETF price change that the signals were based on.  The mistake carried the model portfolio's backtested buy and sell decisions back in time one week, enabling the model to buy an ETF just before the price rose and sell an ETF just before the price fell.  The SEC alleges that the analyst tried to explain this possible calculation error to Present in late September 2008, yet F-Squared went on to advertise the inflated data for the next five years and overstated that AlphaSector significantly outperformed the S&P; 500 from April 2001 to September 2008., \n",
       ", F-Squared consented to the entry of the order finding that it violated Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), 206(4), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 204-2(a)(16), 206(4)-1(a)(5), 206(4)-7, and 206(4)-8.  The order also finds that F-Squared aided and abetted and caused certain mutual funds sub-advised by F-Squared to violation Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  F-Squared acknowledged that its conduct violated federal securities laws, and agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of these provisions.  F-Squared agreed to retain an independent compliance consultant and pay disgorgement of $30 million and a penalty of $5 million. , \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint against Present alleges that he violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), 206(4), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Bill Donahue, Robert Baker, Jose Santillan, and John Farinacci of the Asset Management Unit as well as Rachel Hershfang, Frank Huntington, Mayeti Gametchu, Jennifer Cardello, and Rory Alex of the Boston Regional Office.  The case has been supervised by Kevin Kelcourse.  The SEC's litigation against Present will be led by Mr. Huntington and Ms. Hershfang., \n",

       ", SEC Charges Stock Promoter with Fraudulent Scheme Related to Pre-IPO Facebook and Twitter Shares, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", On December 23, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a stock promoter based in Santa Barbara, Calif., with fraudulently raising nearly $3.5 million from investors purportedly to purchase Facebook and Twitter shares prior to their initial public offerings (IPOs)., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that instead of purchasing the shares in the secondary market as promised, Efstratios \"Elias\" Argyropoulos and his firm Prima Capital Group misappropriated investor funds.  They used the money primarily for day trading of stocks and options as well as to pay off certain investors who complained when they didn't receive the promised Facebook or Twitter shares., \n",
       ", Argyropoulos and Prima Capital agreed to settle the SEC's charges and to be barred from working for an investment adviser or broker-dealer, and financial penalties will be determined at a later date., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleges that Argyropoulos and Prima violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and, against Argyropoulos only, civil money penalties.  , \n",
       ", Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Argyropoulos and Prima consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering them to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and ordering Argyropoulos to pay civil money penalties.  There will be further proceedings before the District Court to determine the amounts of disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil money penalties.  The bifurcated settlement remains subject to court approval.  Argyropoulos also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, to an administrative proceeding order barring him from, among other things, association with any broker, dealer or investment adviser.  The administrative proceeding will be instituted following court approval of the bifurcated settlement., \n",
       ", Also on December 23, 2014, SEC separately announced an administrative proceeding against Khaled A. Eldaher, a registered representative living in Austin, Texas.  The SEC Enforcement Division alleges that while working for a registered broker-dealer, Eldaher reached a side agreement with Argyropoulos to solicit investors and receive 50 percent of the mark-up on Facebook shares he sold.  Eldaher sold $362,887.50 worth of Facebook shares and was paid $15,478 by Prima Capital.  He was later terminated by the broker-dealer for selling securities other than through the firm.  The Enforcement Division alleges that Eldaher's sales of unregistered securities violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  The matter will be scheduled for a public hearing before an administrative law judge for proceedings to adjudicate the Enforcement Division's allegations and determine what, if any, remedial actions are appropriate., \n",

       ", The SEC alleges that while serving as outside counsel to Spectrum Pharmaceuticals last year, Shivbir Grewal learned that the company was on the brink of announcing a significant decline in expected revenue due to an unanticipated drop in orders for its top-selling drug.  Grewal sold his entire investment in Spectrum stock within 48 hours of getting the nonpublic information from company officials who sought the disclosure advice of his law firm.  He tipped his wife Preetinder Grewal, who also sold all of her Spectrum shares on the basis of the nonpublic information.  The day after Grewal sold her stock, Spectrum issued a press release revealing the expectation of decreased sales of the drug Fusilev and the consequent expectation of reduced revenue, and Spectrum's stock price fell more than 35 percent.  Shivbir Grewal and his wife avoided losses of nearly $45,000 by selling ahead of the bad news., \n",

Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Grewals agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions of the securities laws.  Shivbir Grewal agreed to pay disgorgement of $30,343.17, prejudgment interest of $997.68, and a penalty of $30,343.17.  Preetinder Grewal agreed to pay disgorgement of $14,400.05, prejudgment interest of $476.73, and a penalty of $14,400.05.  The settlement is subject to court approval. , \n",

       ", Securities and Exchange Commission v. Howard B. Present, , Civil Action No. 14-CV-14692 (District of Massachusetts, filed December 22, 2014), \n",
       ", SEC Charges Investment Manager F-Squared and Former CEO with Making False Performance Claims, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") today announced that investment management firm F-Squared Investments has agreed to pay $35 million and admit wrongdoing to settle charges that it defrauded investors through false performance advertising about its flagship product., \n",
       ", The SEC separately charged the firm's co-founder and former CEO Howard Present with making false and misleading statements to investors as the public face of F-Squared., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against Massachusetts-based F-Squared, which is the largest marketer of index products using exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the firm began receiving signals from a third-party data provider in September 2008 indicating when to buy or sell an investment.  The signals were based on an algorithm, and F-Squared and Present used the signals to create a model portfolio of sector ETFs that could be rebalanced periodically as the signals changed.  They named the new product \"AlphaSector\" and launched the first index a month later.  AlphaSector's indexes quickly became the firm's largest revenue source, and F-Squared went from losing money to becoming a highly profitable investment manager., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that while marketing AlphaSector into the largest active ETF strategy in the market, F-Squared falsely advertised a successful seven-year track record for the investment strategy based on the actual performance of real investments for real clients.  In reality, the algorithm was not even in existence during the seven years of purported performance success.  The data used in F-Squared's advertising was actually derived through backtesting, which is the application of a quantitative model to historical market data to generate a hypothetical performance during a prior period.  F-Squared and Present specifically advertised the investment strategy as \"not backtested.\"  Furthermore, the hypothetical data contained a substantial performance calculation error that inflated the results by approximately 350 percent., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint against Present filed in federal court in Boston, he was responsible for F-Squared's advertising materials that were often posted on the company website and sent to clients and prospective clients.  Present also was responsible for the descriptions of AlphaSector in its filings with the SEC, and he certified the accuracy of those filings.  F-Squared and Present made the false and misleading statements about AlphaSector from September 2008 to September 2013.  The SEC alleges that they claimed AlphaSector was based on an investment strategy that had been used to invest client assets since April 2001.  Yet Present knew that the algorithm was not finalized until late summer 2008 when he devised rules for turning the signals into a model ETF portfolio and directed an assistant to calculate hypothetical returns for the portfolio going back to April 2001., \n",
       ", The SEC further alleges that the F-Squared analyst who calculated the backtested AlphaSector performance inadvertently applied the buy/sell signals to the week preceding any ETF price change that the signals were based on.  The mistake carried the model portfolio's backtested buy and sell decisions back in time one week, enabling the model to buy an ETF just before the price rose and sell an ETF just before the price fell.  The SEC alleges that the analyst tried to explain this possible calculation error to Present in late September 2008, yet F-Squared went on to advertise the inflated data for the next five years and overstated that AlphaSector significantly outperformed the S&amp;P; 500 from April 2001 to September 2008., \n",
       ", F-Squared consented to the entry of the order finding that it violated Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), 206(4), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 204-2(a)(16), 206(4)-1(a)(5), 206(4)-7, and 206(4)-8.  The order also finds that F-Squared aided and abetted and caused certain mutual funds sub-advised by F-Squared to violation Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  F-Squared acknowledged that its conduct violated federal securities laws, and agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of these provisions.  F-Squared agreed to retain an independent compliance consultant and pay disgorgement of $30 million and a penalty of $5 million. , \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint against Present alleges that he violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), 206(4), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Bill Donahue, Robert Baker, Jose Santillan, and John Farinacci of the Asset Management Unit as well as Rachel Hershfang, Frank Huntington, Mayeti Gametchu, Jennifer Cardello, and Rory Alex of the Boston Regional Office.

       ", SEC Charges Stock Promoter with Fraudulent Scheme Related to Pre-IPO Facebook and Twitter Shares, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", On December 23, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a stock promoter based in Santa Barbara, Calif., with fraudulently raising nearly $3.5 million from investors purportedly to purchase Facebook and Twitter shares prior to their initial public offerings (IPOs)., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that instead of purchasing the shares in the secondary market as promised, Efstratios \"Elias\" Argyropoulos and his firm Prima Capital Group misappropriated investor funds.  They used the money primarily for day trading of stocks and options as well as to pay off certain investors who complained when they didn't receive the promised Facebook or Twitter shares., \n",
       ", Argyropoulos and Prima Capital agreed to settle the SEC's charges and to be barred from working for an investment adviser or broker-dealer, and financial penalties will be determined at a later date., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleges that Argyropoulos and Prima violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and, against Argyropoulos only, civil money penalties.  , \n",
       ", Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Argyropoulos and Prima consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering them to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and ordering Argyropoulos to pay civil money penalties.  There will be further proceedings before the District Court to determine the amounts of disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil money penalties.  The bifurcated settlement remains subject to court approval.  Argyropoulos also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, to an administrative proceeding order barring him from, among other things, association with any broker, dealer or investment adviser.  The administrative proceeding will be instituted following court approval of the bifurcated settlement., \n",
       ", Also on December 23, 2014, SEC separately announced an administrative proceeding against Khaled A. Eldaher, a registered representative living in Austin, Texas.  The SEC Enforcement Division alleges that while working for a registered broker-dealer, Eldaher reached a side agreement with Argyropoulos to solicit investors and receive 50 percent of the mark-up on Facebook shares he sold.  Eldaher sold $362,887.50 worth of Facebook shares and was paid $15,478 by Prima Capital.  He was later terminated by the broker-dealer for selling securities other than through the firm.  The Enforcement Division alleges that Eldaher's sales of unregistered securities violated Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.  The matter will be scheduled for a public hearing before an administrative law judge for proceedings to adjudicate the Enforcement Division's allegations and determine what, if any, remedial actions are appropriate., \n",

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that on December 11, 2014, the Honorable William J. Zloch, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of Florida entered a Final Judgment ordering Defendant Robert B. Cook to pay a $150,000 civil money penalty., \n",

       ", The Commission's complaint, filed on March 19, 2013, alleged that from approximately January 2010 through at least May 2011, E-Monee.com, Inc., its president Estuardo Benavides, and Cook one of its directors, offered shares in E-Monee, while claiming the company owned Mexican bonds purportedly worth billions of dollars, and that E-Monee's shares would substantially increase in value. The complaint alleged that the Mexican bonds were essentially worthless and there was no valid basis for the claims by Benavides and Cook that E-Monee's stock price would increase significantly., \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that while serving as outside counsel to Spectrum Pharmaceuticals last year, Shivbir Grewal learned that the company was on the brink of announcing a significant decline in expected revenue due to an unanticipated drop in orders for its top-selling drug.  Grewal sold his entire investment in Spectrum stock within 48 hours of getting the nonpublic information from company officials who sought the disclosure advice of his law firm.  He tipped his wife Preetinder Grewal, who also sold all of her Spectrum shares on the basis of the nonpublic information.  The day after Grewal sold her stock, Spectrum issued a press release revealing the expectation of decreased sales of the drug Fusilev and the consequent expectation of reduced revenue, and Spectrum's stock price fell more than 35 percent.  Shivbir Grewal and his wife avoided losses of nearly $45,000 by selling ahead of the bad news., \n",
       ", The Grewals agreed to pay $90,000 to settle the SEC's charges, and Shivbir Grewal also agreed to be suspended from practicing as an attorney before the SEC on behalf of any publicly traded company or other entity regulated by the agency., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleges that the Grewals violated Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as well as Rule 10b-5.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Grewals agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions of the securities laws.  Shivbir Grewal agreed to pay disgorgement of $30,343.17, prejudgment interest of $997.68, and a penalty of $30,343.17.  Preetinder Grewal agreed to pay disgorgement of $14,400.05, prejudgment interest of $476.73, and a penalty of $14,400.05.  The settlement is subject to court approval. , \n",

       ", Securities and Exchange Commission v. Howard B. Present, , Civil Action No. 14-CV-14692 (District of Massachusetts, filed December 22, 2014), \n",
       ", SEC Charges Investment Manager F-Squared and Former CEO with Making False Performance Claims, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") today announced that investment management firm F-Squared Investments has agreed to pay $35 million and admit wrongdoing to settle charges that it defrauded investors through false performance advertising about its flagship product., \n",
       ", The SEC separately charged the firm's co-founder and former CEO Howard Present with making false and misleading statements to investors as the public face of F-Squared., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against Massachusetts-based F-Squared, which is the largest marketer of index products using exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the firm began receiving signals from a third-party data provider in September 2008 indicating when to buy or sell an investment.  The signals were based on an algorithm, and F-Squared and Present used the signals to create a model portfolio of sector ETFs that could be rebalanced periodically as the signals changed.  They named the new product \"AlphaSector\" and launched the first index a month later.  AlphaSector's indexes quickly became the firm's largest revenue source, and F-Squared went from losing money to becoming a highly profitable investment manager., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that while marketing AlphaSector into the largest active ETF strategy in the market, F-Squared falsely advertised a successful seven-year track record for the investment strategy based on the actual performance of real investments for real clients.  In reality, the algorithm was not even in existence during the seven years of purported performance success.  The data used in F-Squared's advertising was actually derived through backtesting, which is the application of a quantitative model to historical market data to generate a hypothetical performance during a prior period.  F-Squared and Present specifically advertised the investment strategy as \"not backtested.\"  Furthermore, the hypothetical data contained a substantial performance calculation error that inflated the results by approximately 350 percent., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint against Present filed in federal court in Boston, he was responsible for F-Squared's advertising materials that were often posted on the company website and sent to clients and prospective clients.  Present also was responsible for the descriptions of AlphaSector in its filings with the SEC, and he certified the accuracy of those filings.  F-Squared and Present made the false and misleading statements about AlphaSector from September 2008 to September 2013.  The SEC alleges that they claimed AlphaSector was based on an investment strategy that had been used to invest client assets since April 2001.  Yet Present knew that the algorithm was not finalized until late summer 2008 when he devised rules for turning the signals into a model ETF portfolio and directed an assistant to calculate hypothetical returns for the portfolio going back to April 2001., \n",
       ", The SEC further alleges that the F-Squared analyst who calculated the backtested AlphaSector performance inadvertently applied the buy/sell signals to the week preceding any ETF price change that the signals were based on.  The mistake carried the model portfolio's backtested buy and sell decisions back in time one week, enabling the model to buy an ETF just before the price rose and sell an ETF just before the price fell.  The SEC alleges that the analyst tried to explain this possible calculation error to Present in late September 2008, yet F-Squared went on to advertise the inflated data for the next five years and overstated that AlphaSector significantly outperformed the S&P; 500 from April 2001 to September 2008., \n",
       ", F-Squared consented to the entry of the order finding that it violated Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), 206(4), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rules 204-2(a)(16), 206(4)-1(a)(5), 206(4)-7, and 206(4)-8.  The order also finds that F-Squared aided and abetted and caused certain mutual funds sub-advised by F-Squared to violation Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  F-Squared acknowledged that its conduct violated federal securities laws, and agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of these provisions.  F-Squared agreed to retain an independent compliance consultant and pay disgorgement of $30 million and a penalty of $5 million. , \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint against Present alleges that he violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), 206(4), and 207 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Bill Donahue, Robert Baker, Jose Santillan, and John Farinacci of the Asset Management Unit as well as Rachel Hershfang, Frank Huntington, Mayeti Gametchu, Jennifer Cardello, and Rory Alex of the Boston Regional Office.  The case has been supervised by Kevin Kelcourse.  The SEC's litigation against Present will be led by Mr. Huntington and Ms. Hershfang., \n",

Hamilton -- arising out of their alleged role in accounting misconduct at Nortel Networks Corporation.  The Commission's case, filed in 2007, has been stayed since 2009.
