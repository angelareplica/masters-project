Forbes, the former Chairman of Cendant Corporation (Cendant), in the Commission's action against Forbes arising out of his conduct in the Cendant fraud, Securities and Exchange Commission v. Walter A. Forbes et al., 01 civ 987 (JAP) (D.N.J. filed Feb. 28, 2001).  The Commission's complaint in that action alleged that Forbes orchestrated an earnings management scheme at CUC International Inc. (CUC), a corporate predecessor of Cendant, and, subsequently, at Cendant itself.  The complaint further alleged that over a twelve-year period Forbes directed a scheme that improperly inflated the company's quarterly and annual financial results, and that for the period 1995 to 1997, CUC's operating income was improperly inflated by an aggregate amount exceeding $500 million.  When the fraud was disclosed in 1998, Cendant's common stock dropped dramatically, resulting in defrauded investors losing billions of dollars.\", '\\n', \"The final judgment against Forbes, to which he consented without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b 5, 13b2 1, and 13b2 2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b 20, 13a 1, 13a 13, and 14a 9.

Jaschke (\"Jaschke\") reaped commissions of over $14 million by engaging in unauthorized and unsuitable trading on behalf of the City of Kissimmee, Fla. and the Tohopekaliga Water Authority (collectively, the \"Municipalities\"), and by churning their accounts.  While associated with the brokerage firm First Allied Securities, Inc., Jaschke lied to his customers about his fraudulent trading, which resulted in an aggregate, unrealized loss of approximately $60 million for a two year period.', '\\n', \"The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Fla., alleges that Jaschke engaged in a high risk, short term trading strategy involving zero-coupon United States Treasury bonds, the value of which were very sensitive to interest rate changes.  For example, if interest rates were to increase by only 1%, the value of a 30-year bond would drop by 25%.  Jaschke's risky trading strategy involved buying and selling the same bond within a matter of days, and sometimes within the same day.  The complaint alleges that Jaschke exposed the Municipalities to greater risks when he leveraged their accounts using repurchase agreements.  Jaschke employed repurchase agreements to finance the bond purchases the Municipalities would not otherwise have been able to afford.  The complaint alleges this strategy dramatically increased the risks as Jaschke caused the Municipalities to borrow large sums of money to hold larger bond positions.\", '\\n', \"The complaint alleges Jaschke, age 49 of Houston, Tex., knew the Municipalities' ordinances prohibited his trading strategy as they required that their funds be invested with the paramount consideration to be safety of capital.  Further, the complaint alleges Jaschke knew that the Municipalities prohibited the use of repurchase agreements for investment.  According to the complaint, had the bond market not swung sharply in Jaschke's favor allowing the Municipalities to close their accounts with a modest profit, the Municipalities could have lost millions of dollars as a result of his misconduct.\", '\\n', 'The Commission\\'s complaint alleges that Jaschke violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of the broker-dealer books and records provisions, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-4(b)(4) thereunder.  The Commission\\'s complaint seeks a permanent injunction and disgorgement with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty.', '\\n', \"In a related action, the Commission instituted settled administrative proceedings against Jeffrey C. Young, First Allied's former vice president of supervision, for failing to reasonably supervise Jaschke.  The order found Young failed to respond adequately to red flags relating to Jaschke, and failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that First Allied's procedures regarding suitability were followed.  The Commission's order suspends Young from acting in a supervisory capacity for nine months and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  Young consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the Commission's findings.

Biddlecome (\"Biddlecome\"), age 41, of Carpentaria, California, his firm California Wealth Management Group, doing business as IFC Advisory (\"IFC\"), of Culver City, California, a fund created by Biddlecome, Homestead Properties, L.P. (\"Homestead\"), the general partner of the fund, Homestead Limited L.L.C., and William C. Tak, age 43, of Newport Beach, California, to halt the continuing false disclosures being made by Homestead, Biddlecome, and Tak. The Honorable Cormac J. Carney, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, also granted additional relief that the Commission sought including orders freezing assets, and appointing Robb Evans &amp; Associates LLC as permanent receiver over Homestead.', '\\n', \"The Commission's complaint, filed November 12, in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Biddlecome established Homestead to invest in mobile home park communities. Rather than investing all of the investors' moneys as represented, Biddlecome, without ever informing investors, transferred $4.5 million of the partnership's moneys to a brokerage account and engaged in day-trading, including trading options, trading on margin, and engaging in short sales. The complaint alleges that this risky day-trading strategy has resulted in erratic performance, alternating between six figure trading losses to profits in various months; in September and October 2009 alone, the account value declined $1.9 million. The complaint also alleges that the defendants falsely claimed that a brokerage firm would sell the partnership interests and an accounting firm would audit the partnership's books yearly. In addition, although investors were told distributions would be made quarterly out of net profits and certain investors received distributions, Homestead suffered losses for two years.\", '\\n', \"The Commission's complaint charges the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 15(a) and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and names as relief defendants two entities controlled by Biddlecome, Homestead Northland MHC, LLC and Jackson MHC, L.L.C. The Commission alleges that the relief defendants received ill-gotten gains as a result of Biddlecome's conduct.\", '\\n', \"On November 16, 2009, the Honorable Cormac J. Carney, United States District Judge, granted the Commission's application for a temporary restraining order against the defendants and issued orders freezing Homestead's assets and prohibiting the destruction of documents. The Judge also appointed Robb Evans &amp; Associates LLC as the temporary receiver over Homestead. The Commission also seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties against the defendants.\", '\\n', 'For further information, see Litigation Release No. ', '21304', ' (November 18, 2009).', '\\n', '\\n\\xa0\\n', '\\n', 'http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21353.htm', '\\n', ' BEGIN FOOTER ', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Home', ' | ', 'Previous Page', '\\n', 'Modified: 12/24/2009', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n']</td>\n",

(CUC), a corporate predecessor of Cendant, and, subsequently, at Cendant itself.  The complaint further alleged that over a twelve-year period Forbes directed a scheme that improperly inflated the company's quarterly and annual financial results, and that for the period 1995 to 1997, CUC's operating income was improperly inflated by an aggregate amount exceeding $500 million.  When the fraud was disclosed in 1998, Cendant's common stock dropped dramatically, resulting in defrauded investors losing billions of dollars.\", '\\n', \"The final judgment against Forbes, to which he consented without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b 5, 13b2 1, and 13b2 2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b 20, 13a 1, 13a 13, and 14a 9.

Jaschke's risky trading strategy involved buying and selling the same bond within a matter of days, and sometimes within the same day.  The complaint alleges that Jaschke exposed the Municipalities to greater risks when he leveraged their accounts using repurchase agreements.

Further, the complaint alleges Jaschke knew that the Municipalities prohibited the use of repurchase agreements for investment.  According to the complaint, had the bond market not swung sharply in Jaschke's favor allowing the Municipalities to close their accounts with a modest profit, the Municipalities could have lost millions of dollars as a result of his misconduct.\", '\\n', 'The Commission\\'s complaint alleges that Jaschke violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of the broker-dealer books and records provisions, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-4(b)(4) thereunder.

Young, First Allied's former vice president of supervision, for failing to reasonably supervise Jaschke.  The order found Young failed to respond adequately to red flags relating to Jaschke, and failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that First Allied's procedures regarding suitability were followed.  The Commission's order suspends Young from acting in a supervisory capacity for nine months and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.

(\"Homestead\"), the general partner of the fund, Homestead Limited L.L.C., and William C. Tak, age 43, of Newport Beach, California, to halt the continuing false disclosures being made by Homestead, Biddlecome, and Tak. The Honorable Cormac J. Carney, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, also granted additional relief that the Commission sought including orders freezing assets, and appointing Robb Evans & Associates LLC as permanent receiver over Homestead.', '\\n', \"The Commission's complaint, filed November 12, in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Biddlecome established Homestead to invest in mobile home park communities. Rather than investing all of the investors' moneys as represented, Biddlecome, without ever informing investors, transferred $4.5 million of the partnership's moneys to a brokerage account and engaged in day-trading, including trading options, trading on margin, and engaging in short sales. The complaint alleges that this risky day-trading strategy has resulted in erratic performance, alternating between six figure trading losses to profits in various months; in September and October 2009 alone, the account value declined $1.9 million. The complaint also alleges that the defendants falsely claimed that a brokerage firm would sell the partnership interests and an accounting firm would audit the partnership's books yearly. In addition, although investors were told distributions would be made quarterly out of net profits and certain investors received distributions, Homestead suffered losses for two years.\", '\\n', \"The Commission's complaint charges the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 15(a) and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and names as relief defendants two entities controlled by Biddlecome, Homestead Northland MHC, LLC and Jackson MHC, L.L.C. The Commission alleges that the relief defendants received ill-gotten gains as a result of Biddlecome's conduct.\", '\\n', \"On November 16, 2009, the Honorable Cormac J. Carney, United States District Judge, granted the Commission's application for a temporary restraining order against the defendants and issued orders freezing Homestead's assets and prohibiting the destruction of documents. The Judge also appointed Robb Evans & Associates LLC as the temporary receiver over Homestead.

Fry and Fry\\'s promoters, Bevan J. Wilde, Gary W. Hansen, Michael G. Butcher, James B. Mooring, David G. Bartholomew, and Michael W. Averett (collectively, the \"Promoters\"), raised approximately $41 million from the unregistered offer and sale of high-yield promissory notes to over 150 investors in several states, over half of which was lost to investors. According to the complaint, around $18 million of the funds raised by Fry and the Promoters was funneled by Fry into a Ponzi scheme run by Jeffrey L. Mowen, a convicted felon and securities law recidivist, who misappropriated over $8 million of these funds. The complaint also alleges that Fry and the Promoters knowingly or recklessly distributed private placement memoranda to investors that misrepresented the level of their due diligence and falsely stated that all the funds were being used to make collateralized domestic real estate loans and domestic small business loans. The complaint further alleges that, Fry, who dealt directly with Mowen, committed fraud by failing to disclose Mowen\\'s involvement and criminal history to the Promoters and investors. According to the complaint, Fry and the Promoters also committed registration violations with respect to the securities offerings and their status as brokers.', '\\n', 'The Commission\\'s complaint alleges that, as a result of their conduct, the defendants violated, and unless enjoined, will continue to violate, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Fry and the Promoters violated, and unless enjoined, will continue to violate Sections 5(a) and 5(c) the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. As part of this action, the Commission seeks against each of the defendants an injunction against future violations of the provisions set forth above, disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, and third tier civil money penalties.

Merriman repeatedly deceived investors, many of whom considered him a personal friend, by sending them fictitious account statements showing annual rates of return of 7 to 20 percent. Instead, Merriman did not trade stocks and options after his first year of operations, during which he suffered trading losses, and he used millions of dollars in investor funds to support his lavish lifestyle and pay out withdrawals by other investors. He also offered \"rebates\" to existing investors to entice them to invest additional money with him.

The Complaint further alleges that Smart went to great lengths to convince investors that he was a sophisticated financial planner, when in fact he was misappropriating funds for his own personal use and investing the remaining funds entrusted to him in illiquid and ill-fated real estate ventures.  According to the Complaint, Smart falsely represented to investors that he was providing a conservative, sound investment opportunity for them to receive regular, monthly income.  The Complaint also alleges that Smart solicited additional investors by providing these new investors with promissory notes and \"membership certificates\" in Smart Assets, claiming an interest payable on the notes ranging from 8.5% to 18% interest per annum.  The Complaint further alleges that the defendants offered promissory notes to other investors falsely representing that they were using the invested money to lend out at higher rates.  The actual uses to which the money was put were allegedly not disclosed to investors.  According to the Complaint, Smart, through Smart Assets, operated a Ponzi-like scheme by using proceeds obtained from new investors to make payments to early investors.

Utah)', '\\n', 'SEC Obtains Summary Judgment against Defendants in Fraudulent Investment Scheme', '\\n', 'The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on June 6, 2011, the Honorable Dale A. Kimball of the United States District Court for the District of Utah granted the SEC’s motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment against defendants Brian J. Smart of Lehi, Utah, and his company Smart Assets, LLC. The Court found that Smart and his company violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordered defendants to pay $4.7 million in disgorgement and civil penalties.', '\\n', 'The SEC filed this action against the defendants on March 11, 2009, alleging that Smart and his company had engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme in the offer and sale of promissory notes and other securities. The complaint alleged that Smart falsely represented to investors, including senior citizens, that he was providing a conservative, liquid investment opportunity. Instead, according to the complaint, Smart was misappropriating investor funds for his own personal use, investing in illiquid and ill-fated real estate ventures, and using proceeds from new investors to make payments to earlier investors.', '\\n', 'On the day this action was filed, the Court granted the SEC’s motion for a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other preliminary relief. Subsequently, on August 21, 2009, the Court granted the SEC’s motion for a preliminary injunction against the defendants.', '\\n', 'After completion of discovery in this case, the parties moved for summary judgment. In granting the SEC’s motion for summary judgment and entering final judgment, the Court found that Smart and his company misappropriated over $2.05 million from investors through a “systematic program of deception and fraud.” The Court found that Smart targeted elderly investors and that he falsely represented that he would place investor funds in safe, principal guaranteed investments. Instead, the Court found, Smart used investor money to pay personal expenses, to invest in risky real estate ventures and hard money loans, and to pay purported “dividends” to other investors.', '\\n', 'The Court’s final judgment against Smart and Smart Assets permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and orders defendants to pay $2,059,077 in disgorgement, $597,426 in prejudgment interest, and a $2,059,077 civil penalty.', '\\n', 'For further information regarding this case, see Litigation Release No. ', '20946', ' (March 12, 2009).', '\\n', '\\xa0', '\\n', 'http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22001.htm', '\\n', ' BEGIN FOOTER ', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Home', ' | ', 'Previous Page', '\\n', 'Modified: 06/14/2011', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n']</td>\n",

', '\\n', 'The SEC’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, alleges that from at least June 2005 through June 2010, Joseph Nelson and his associates, including at various times Wilcox and Thoennes, solicited at least $16 million from more than 100 persons to invest in promissory notes offered by Joseph Nelson’s companies.  Joseph Nelson, Wilcox, and Thoennes told investors — many of whom are fellow members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (“LDS”) that Nelson identified and targeted through church connections and during church functions — that Joseph Nelson and his companies were engaged in the business of purchasing “merchant portfolios” of credit card processing accounts, holding them for a certain period of time, and then selling them for a profit to financial institutions, such as banks.', '\\n', 'According to the SEC’s complaint, Joseph Nelson, Wilcox, and Thoennes lured investors by offering extraordinary rates of return.  Most investors were given promissory notes promising returns of 14% to 60% on an annualized basis and additional premium of 20% to 60% at maturity.  Some investors were simply told that they would double their money.  ', '\\n', 'The SEC alleges that Joseph Nelson and his companies never purchased or sold a single merchant portfolio.  The money invested with Joseph Nelson and his companies was instead used by Nelson to make incremental payments to investors in a Ponzi-scheme fashion, to pay his associates, including Wilcox and Thoennes, and to pay his own lavish personal expenses, as well as those of other family members. ', '\\n', 'The SEC’s complaint alleges that between May 2008 and July 2010, Wilcox raised and helped to raise approximately $3 million from at least 11 people.  Between August 2009 and January 2010, Thoennes raised and helped to raise at least $1.5 million from at least 4 persons, and solicited investments from at least 15 other individuals who did not invest with the Nelson companies.  ', '\\n', 'The SEC’s complaint also alleges that Eric Nelson, Joseph Nelson’s brother, created fictitious documents that Joseph Nelson and his associates used to mislead investors into believing that Joseph Nelson and his companies were engaged in the business of buying and selling merchant credit card portfolios.  In addition, the SEC claims that Eric Nelson created fictitious bank account statements reflecting balances in his brother’s accounts that were far in excess of the actual amounts in those accounts, which deceived investors about the continued viability of Joseph Nelson and his companies.', '\\n', 'The SEC’s complaint charges that Wilcox, Thoennes, and Eric Nelson each violated and aided and abetted violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws — Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that Wilcox and Thoennes violated the broker-dealer and securities registration provisions of the securities laws — Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and Exchange Act Section 15(a).

Fry and Fry\\'s promoters, Bevan J. Wilde, Gary W. Hansen, Michael G. Butcher, James B. Mooring, David G. Bartholomew, and Michael W. Averett (collectively, the \"Promoters\"), raised approximately $41 million from the unregistered offer and sale of high-yield promissory notes to over 150 investors in several states, over half of which was lost to investors. According to the complaint, around $18 million of the funds raised by Fry and the Promoters was funneled by Fry into a Ponzi scheme run by Jeffrey L. Mowen, a convicted felon and securities law recidivist, who misappropriated over $8 million of these funds. The complaint also alleges that Fry and the Promoters knowingly or recklessly distributed private placement memoranda to investors that misrepresented the level of their due diligence and falsely stated that all the funds were being used to make collateralized domestic real estate loans and domestic small business loans. The complaint further alleges that, Fry, who dealt directly with Mowen, committed fraud by failing to disclose Mowen\\'s involvement and criminal history to the Promoters and investors. According to the complaint, Fry and the Promoters also committed registration violations with respect to the securities offerings and their status as brokers.', '\\n', 'The Commission\\'s complaint alleges that, as a result of their conduct, the defendants violated, and unless enjoined, will continue to violate, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Fry and the Promoters violated, and unless enjoined, will continue to violate Sections 5(a) and 5(c) the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. As part of this action, the Commission seeks against each of the defendants an injunction against future violations of the provisions set forth above, disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, and third tier civil money penalties.

Contrary to his representations to investors, the SEC alleges that Merriman used investor funds to repay other investors and for his own personal purchases of classic cars, motorcycles, motor homes, a cabin in Idaho, and fine art collections, including works by Rembrandt that are worth millions of dollars.', '\\n', \"The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.

Jenkins of the United States District Court for the District of Utah also froze the defendants' assets, ordered that discovery be accelerated and that defendants be prohibited from destroying documents, ordered the defendants to promptly provide sworn accountings of investor funds and other assets, and ordered that a preliminary injunction hearing be held on March 20, 2009, to determine if the interim relief should be continued.\", '\\n', 'The Commission\\'s Complaint, filed on March 11, alleges that Smart, a resident of Lehi, Utah, and Smart Assets engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme in the offer and sale of promissory notes and other securities over a period extending back at least six years.  According to the Complaint, the defendants fraudulently raised approximately $1.68 million from investors, including senior citizens.  The Complaint further alleges that Smart went to great lengths to convince investors that he was a sophisticated financial planner, when in fact he was misappropriating funds for his own personal use and investing the remaining funds entrusted to him in illiquid and ill-fated real estate ventures.  According to the Complaint, Smart falsely represented to investors that he was providing a conservative, sound investment opportunity for them to receive regular, monthly income.  The Complaint also alleges that Smart solicited additional investors by providing these new investors with promissory notes and \"membership certificates\" in Smart Assets, claiming an interest payable on the notes ranging from 8.5% to 18% interest per annum.  The Complaint further alleges that the defendants offered promissory notes to other investors falsely representing that they were using the invested money to lend out at higher rates.  The actual uses to which the money was put were allegedly not disclosed to investors.

The Commission obtained an emergency court order freezing assets and halting the scheme that was ongoing. The Commission also named five relief defendants.', 'The Commission\\'s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, alleges that from approximately June 2005 through January 2007, Anthony C. Zufelt (\"Zufelt\") and Joseph A. Nelson (\"Nelson\") raised at least $3.6 million by convincing at least 36 investors to invest in offerings by defendants Zufelt, Inc. and Silver Leaf Investments, Inc. The complaint alleges that Zufelt and Nelson promised investment returns of up to 220% and fraudulently claimed that Zufelt ran a profitable credit card transaction processing business that was selling secure investments backed by a so-called \"merchant portfolio\" of credit card processing accounts. According to the complaint, defendants David Decker and Cache Decker acted as promoters and helped Zufelt and Nelson solicit investors for these schemes.', 'The complaint further alleges that from approximately August 2005 to the present day, Nelson has separately solicited investors by fraudulently claiming that he buys and sells merchant portfolios for a profit through his companies, defendants JCN, Inc., JCN Capital, LLC, and JCN International, LLC. To date, Nelson has raised at least $12 million from over 100 investors by promising investors that their investments were secure and that he would provide investment returns of up to 200% in a very short period of time.', \"According to the Commission's complaint, Zufelt, Nelson, David Decker and Cache Decker each solicited members of the Mormon community to invest in these schemes. The complaint further alleges that Zufelt, Nelson, David Decker and Cache Decker each encouraged and convinced potential investors to borrow against their homes in order to invest in these schemes.\", \"Unbeknownst to investors in any of the three Ponzi schemes, as the complaint alleges, Zufelt and Nelson misused investors' funds to pay personal expenses, pay commissions and bonuses to associates, fund unrelated businesses, make gifts, and make payments to investors in order to perpetuate their schemes. The complaint further alleges that both Zufelt and Nelson diverted investor funds to friends and family members, some of whom are named relief defendants in the Commission's complaint.\", \"The Commission's complaint alleges violations of the antifraud, registration, and broker-dealer provisions of the federal securities laws: Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement, civil penalties, and officer and director bars against Zufelt, Nelson, David Decker and Cache Decker. The complaint also seeks disgorgement of investor funds or other illicit benefits obtained by relief defendants Jennifer M. Zufelt (Zufelt's former wife), Shae L.

Chief Executive Jeffery A. Lowrance, who had fled to Peru and was arrested there earlier this year, was arraigned today on criminal fraud charges in a 2010 indictment filed by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois. In addition, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed fraud charges Thursday against Lowrance and First Capital.', '\\n', 'The SEC alleges that Lowrance raised approximately $21 million from investors in at least 26 states, including California, Oregon, Illinois and Utah by promising huge profits from a specialized foreign currency trading program.  In reality, First Capital conducted little foreign currency trading, lost money on the little trading that it conducted, and never engaged in any profitable business operations.  Lowrance targeted investors by purporting to share their Christian values and limited-government political views.  He solicited investors through, among other things, ads in his start-up newspaper ', 'USA Tomorrow', ', which he distributed at a September 2, 2008 political rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  ', '\\n', 'According to the SEC’s complaint, filed in federal district court in San Jose, California, Lowrance and First Capital promised investors a “predictable monthly income,” with monthly returns up to 7.15 percent through foreign currency trading.  Some investors were told their investment was guaranteed, and were given bogus letters of credit.  First Capital also published a spreadsheet purporting to show its multi-year history of profitable trades.  In fact, the trades were fictitious.  Instead of engaging in foreign currency trading as claimed, Lowrance and First Capital secretly diverted investor funds to pay fake returns to other, earlier investors, to pay Lowrance (despite his failure to earn a profit for the investors), and to fund his newspaper.', '\\n', 'Lowrance’s scheme began to unravel in June 2008 and Lowrance and First Capital had lost all of the investors’ money by September 2008.  Nevertheless, Lowrance solicited at least an additional $1 million from at least 36 investors between June 2008 and February 2009 by continuing to tout First Capital’s fictitious high returns, the SEC alleges.', '\\n', 'The Commission’s complaint alleges Lowrance and First Capital violated Sections Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 5 and

Kimball of the United States District Court for the District of Utah granted the SEC’s motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment against defendants Brian J. Smart of Lehi, Utah, and his company Smart Assets, LLC. The Court found that Smart and his company violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordered defendants to pay $4.7 million in disgorgement and civil penalties.', '\\n', 'The SEC filed this action against the defendants on March 11, 2009, alleging that Smart and his company had engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme in the offer and sale of promissory notes and other securities. The complaint alleged that Smart falsely represented to investors, including senior citizens, that he was providing a conservative, liquid investment opportunity. Instead, according to the complaint, Smart was misappropriating investor funds for his own personal use, investing in illiquid and ill-fated real estate ventures, and using proceeds from new investors to make payments to earlier investors.', '\\n', 'On the day this action was filed, the Court granted the SEC’s motion for a temporary restraining order, asset freeze, and other preliminary relief.

In granting the SEC’s motion for summary judgment and entering final judgment, the Court found that Smart and his company misappropriated over $2.05 million from investors through a “systematic program of deception and fraud.” The Court found that Smart targeted elderly investors and that he falsely represented that he would place investor funds in safe, principal guaranteed investments. Instead, the Court found, Smart used investor money to pay personal expenses, to invest in risky real estate ventures and hard money loans, and to pay purported “dividends” to other investors.', '\\n', 'The Court’s final judgment against Smart and Smart Assets permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the

The complaint further alleges that Clark did not deploy investor capital to make payday loans as represented, but instead diverted investor funds to maintain a lavish lifestyle, including buying expensive cars, art and a home theatre system.

Watson, a resident of Mapleton, Utah, and Joshua F. Escobedo, a resident of Spanish Fork, Utah, alleging that each of the Defendants violated the antifraud and securities offering registration provisions, and that Watson and Escobedo violated the broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws.', '\\n', 'In its Complaint, the Commission alleges that from October 2004 through February 2009, Defendants raised more than $27.5 million from more than 120 investors through Mike Watson Capital’s issuance of promissory notes. According to the Complaint, Watson and Escobedo told investors that returns were generated by real estate investments, and backed by substantial equity and cash flow produced by company properties. In reality, the properties never generated sufficient income to cover investment interest or redemptions, and therefore investor returns were paid primarily from new investors’ funds.', '\\n', 'Mike Watson Capital, Watson, and Escobedo agreed to settle the SEC’s charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint.

Fry, Bevan J. Wilde, Gary W. Hansen, Michael G. Butcher, James B. Mooring, and Michael W. Averett ordering disgorgement and civil penalties totaling over $20 million.  Previously, pursuant to stipulation, the court entered permanent injunctions against these defendants enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws.  The SEC Complaint alleged that these defendants acted as promoters for a Ponzi scheme operated by Jeffrey L. Mowen, who is currently serving a 10-year prison term for his actions.  The Complaint alleged that the promoters raised millions of dollars through the unregistered offer and sale of high-yield promissory notes to over 150 investors in several states.  The funds raised were then funneled to Mowen through Thomas Fry, who used the funds for his personal benefit, misappropriating over $8 million.', '\\n', 'The Court ordered that the defendants disgorge the following amounts of ill-gotten gains and civil penalties, respectively:  Thomas Fry - $16,751,439.94 and $250,000; Bevan Wilde - $1,326,241.77 and $130,000; James Mooring - $505,521.84 and $130,000; Michael Averett - $774,936.02 and $130,000; Gary Hansen - $349,481.33 and $130,000; Michael Butcher - $201,278.11 and $130,000.', '\\n', \"The Court also granted, in part, the Commission's motion for summary judgment against defendant and promoter David G.

The Court granted summary judgment against Bartholomew for violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 for the offer and sale of unregistered securities and of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for acting as an unregistered broker-dealer.  The Court found issues of material fact concerning materiality and scienter as to misrepresentations Bartholomew made to investors and thus denied summary judgment for violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Joseph Nelson, Wilcox, and Thoennes told investors — many of whom are fellow members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (“LDS”) that Nelson identified and targeted through church connections and during church functions — that Joseph Nelson and his companies were engaged in the business of purchasing “merchant portfolios” of credit card processing accounts, holding them for a certain period of time, and then selling them for a profit to financial institutions, such as banks.', '\\n', 'According to the SEC’s complaint, Joseph Nelson, Wilcox, and Thoennes lured investors by offering extraordinary rates of return.  Most investors were given promissory notes promising returns of 14% to 60% on an annualized basis and additional premium of 20% to 60% at maturity.  Some investors were simply told that they would double their money.  ', '\\n', 'The SEC alleges that Joseph Nelson and his companies never purchased or sold a single merchant portfolio.  The money invested with Joseph Nelson and his companies was instead used by Nelson to make incremental payments to investors in a Ponzi-scheme fashion, to pay his associates, including Wilcox and Thoennes, and to pay his own lavish personal expenses, as well as those of other family members. ', '\\n', 'The SEC’s complaint alleges that between May 2008 and July 2010, Wilcox raised and helped to raise approximately $3 million from at least 11 people.  Between August 2009 and January 2010, Thoennes raised and helped to raise at least $1.5 million from at least 4 persons, and solicited investments from at least 15 other individuals who did not invest with the Nelson companies.  ', '\\n', 'The SEC’s complaint also alleges that Eric Nelson, Joseph Nelson’s brother, created fictitious documents that Joseph Nelson and his associates used to mislead investors into believing that Joseph Nelson and his companies were engaged in the business of buying and selling merchant credit card portfolios.  In addition, the SEC claims that Eric Nelson created fictitious bank account statements reflecting balances in his brother’s accounts that were far in excess of the actual amounts in those accounts, which deceived investors about the continued viability of Joseph Nelson and his companies.', '\\n', 'The SEC’s complaint charges that Wilcox, Thoennes, and Eric Nelson each violated and aided and abetted violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws — Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that Wilcox and Thoennes violated the broker-dealer and securities registration provisions of the securities laws — Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, and Exchange Act Section 15(a).  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and civil penalties against Wilcox, Thoennes, and Eric Nelson.

The complaint further alleges that investor funds are being used to falsely create the appearance of a successful investment business although S.B. Heinz has actually lost approximately $1.5 million executing Heinz’s high risk futures contract trading activities.

The Complaint alleges Franquelin and Pool encouraged investors to convert funds held in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) into self-directed IRAs through Destiny Funding, LLC, another company owned by Franquelin and Pool, before investing those funds with Elva Group. Franquelin and Pool claimed to use investor funds to develop real estate and guaranteed returns ranging from 10% to 240% per year.\\xa0 Instead of using investor funds as represented, it is alleged that Franquelin and Pool misappropriated investor money for their personal use, to make “interest” payments to earlier investors, and to pay for continuing Elva Group expenses.\\xa0 ', '\\n', 'The Commission alleges that by engaging in this conduct Franquelin and Pool violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

According to the SEC complaint, Scoville began operating Traffic Monsoon in October 2014 as a combination Internet traffic exchange and pay-per-click program and recruited more than 162,000 investors around the world. According to the complaint, although Traffic Monsoon markets itself as a highly successful company, nearly all of its revenue is generated by other investors, not its products or services.

Bramlette of Salt Lake City was the ringleader of the fraud and arranged for the purchase of the Melrose Resort in 2011.  The other defendants, Anthony Hartman, Travis Kozlowski and Aaron Wernli, helped raised money for the project.  According to the complaint, from at least 2014, investors were promised returns of up to 24% and were encouraged to put their retirement savings in the resort.  In reality, the resort was uninhabitable and was suffering significant losses each month.  The resort was in foreclosure and parts of it were put up for auction for unpaid property taxes.  The defendants lost their ownership in the resort when they defaulted on a series of loans, but continued to raise money from unsuspecting investors without disclosing that they had lost everything.  In addition, Bramlette used a substantial amount of investor funds to pay for his lavish lifestyle, including purchases on Rodeo Drive, and automobiles for friends and family.

Bramlette, Hartman, Kozlowski and their associated entities are also charged with violating an antifraud provision of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act.
