       ", UTStarcom agreed to settle the SEC's charges and pay a $1.5 million penalty among other remedies. In a related criminal case, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today that UTStarcom agreed to pay an additional $1.5 million fine., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that UTStarcom's wholly-owned subsidiary in China paid nearly $7 million between 2002 and 2007 for hundreds of overseas trips by employees of Chinese government-controlled telecommunications companies that were customers of UTStarcom, purportedly to provide customer training. In reality, the trips were entirely or primarily for sightseeing., \n",
       ", The SEC further alleges that UTStarcom provided lavish gifts and all-expenses paid executive training programs in the U.S. for existing and potential foreign government customers in China and Thailand. UTStarcom also purported to hire individuals affiliated with foreign government customers to work in the U.S. and provided them with work visas, when in reality the individuals did no work for UTStarcom. According to the SEC, UTStarcom also made improper payments to sham consultants in China and Mongolia while knowing that they would pay bribes to foreign government officials., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges UTStarcom with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA (Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, respectively). UTStarcom agreed, without admitting or denying the charges, to the entry of a permanent injunction against FCPA violations and to provide the SEC with annual FCPA compliance reports and certifications for four years, in addition to paying the $1.5 million penalty., \n",

       ", Former Cendant Corporation Chairman Walter A. Forbes Settles SEC Fraud Action, \n",
       ", Text goes here, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) announced that on December 29, 2009, a settled final judgment was entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Walter A. Forbes, the former Chairman of Cendant Corporation (Cendant), in the Commission's action against Forbes arising out of his conduct in the Cendant fraud, Securities and Exchange Commission v. Walter A. Forbes et al., 01 civ 987 (JAP) (D.N.J. filed Feb. 28, 2001).  The Commission's complaint in that action alleged that Forbes orchestrated an earnings management scheme at CUC International Inc. (CUC), a corporate predecessor of Cendant, and, subsequently, at Cendant itself.  The complaint further alleged that over a twelve-year period Forbes directed a scheme that improperly inflated the company's quarterly and annual financial results, and that for the period 1995 to 1997, CUC's operating income was improperly inflated by an aggregate amount exceeding $500 million.  When the fraud was disclosed in 1998, Cendant's common stock dropped dramatically, resulting in defrauded investors losing billions of dollars., \n",
       ", The final judgment against Forbes, to which he consented without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b 5, 13b2 1, and 13b2 2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b 20, 13a 1, 13a 13, and 14a 9.  The final judgment also bars Forbes, pursuant to Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, from serving as an officer or director of a public company., \n",
       ", Forbes was convicted in a related federal criminal prosecution of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and making false filings with the Commission.  In 2007, Forbes was sentenced to 151 months in prison and ordered to pay criminal restitution of $3.275 billion.  Later that year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed his judgment of conviction.  In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Forbes' petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of his conviction.\n",

       ", SEC Charges Houston-Based Broker With Defrauding Florida Municipalties, \n",
       ", Text goes here, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Commission\") filed an action today charging a Houston-based broker with defrauding two Florida municipalities., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint alleges that Harold H. Jaschke (\"Jaschke\") reaped commissions of over $14 million by engaging in unauthorized and unsuitable trading on behalf of the City of Kissimmee, Fla. and the Tohopekaliga Water Authority (collectively, the \"Municipalities\"), and by churning their accounts.  While associated with the brokerage firm First Allied Securities, Inc., Jaschke lied to his customers about his fraudulent trading, which resulted in an aggregate, unrealized loss of approximately $60 million for a two year period., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Fla., alleges that Jaschke engaged in a high risk, short term trading strategy involving zero-coupon United States Treasury bonds, the value of which were very sensitive to interest rate changes.  For example, if interest rates were to increase by only 1%, the value of a 30-year bond would drop by 25%.  Jaschke's risky trading strategy involved buying and selling the same bond within a matter of days, and sometimes within the same day.  The complaint alleges that Jaschke exposed the Municipalities to greater risks when he leveraged their accounts using repurchase agreements.  Jaschke employed repurchase agreements to finance the bond purchases the Municipalities would not otherwise have been able to afford.  The complaint alleges this strategy dramatically increased the risks as Jaschke caused the Municipalities to borrow large sums of money to hold larger bond positions., \n",
       ", The complaint alleges Jaschke, age 49 of Houston, Tex., knew the Municipalities' ordinances prohibited his trading strategy as they required that their funds be invested with the paramount consideration to be safety of capital.  Further, the complaint alleges Jaschke knew that the Municipalities prohibited the use of repurchase agreements for investment.  According to the complaint, had the bond market not swung sharply in Jaschke's favor allowing the Municipalities to close their accounts with a modest profit, the Municipalities could have lost millions of dollars as a result of his misconduct., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint alleges that Jaschke violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of the broker-dealer books and records provisions, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-4(b)(4) thereunder.  The Commission's complaint seeks a permanent injunction and disgorgement with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty., \n",
       ", In a related action, the Commission instituted settled administrative proceedings against Jeffrey C. Young, First Allied's former vice president of supervision, for failing to reasonably supervise Jaschke.  The order found Young failed to respond adequately to red flags relating to Jaschke, and failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that First Allied's procedures regarding suitability were followed.  The Commission's order suspends Young from acting in a supervisory capacity for nine months and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  Young consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the Commission's findings.   For further information see , Exchange Act Release No. 34-61247, ., \n",

The Commission’s complaint alleged that from April 2008 through December 2008, HomePals, and their principals, Bass, Abner Alabre and Brian J. Taglieri, raised at least $14.3 million through the sale of unsecured notes to hundreds of Haitian-American investors by promising guaranteed returns of 100% every 90 days.  The defendants claimed they were able to generate such spectacular returns through. Bass’ purported successful trading of stock options and commodities.  The Commission’s complaint further alleged that, in reality, Bass traded no more than $1.2 million of the $14.3 million raised, generated trading losses of 19 percent, and that HomePals used the bulk of the investor funds to repay earlier investors in typical Ponzi scheme fashion., \n",

       ", Securities and Exchange Commission v. Homestead Properties, L.P.; Homestead Limited, L.L.C.; California Wealth Management Group, d.b.a. IFC Advisory; Heath M. Biddlecome; William C. Tak, Defendants; and Homestead Northland MHC, LLC and Jackson MHC, L.L.C., Relief Defendants, , United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No. SACV 09-01331 CJC (filed Nov. 12, 2009)., \n",
       ", SEC OBTAINS PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION OVER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP MANAGED BY CULVER CITY ADVISER, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it obtained a preliminary injunction against Heath M. Biddlecome (\"Biddlecome\"), age 41, of Carpentaria, California, his firm California Wealth Management Group, doing business as IFC Advisory (\"IFC\"), of Culver City, California, a fund created by Biddlecome, Homestead Properties, L.P. (\"Homestead\"), the general partner of the fund, Homestead Limited L.L.C., and William C. Tak, age 43, of Newport Beach, California, to halt the continuing false disclosures being made by Homestead, Biddlecome, and Tak. The Honorable Cormac J. Carney, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, also granted additional relief that the Commission sought including orders freezing assets, and appointing Robb Evans &amp; Associates LLC as permanent receiver over Homestead., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint, filed November 12, in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Biddlecome established Homestead to invest in mobile home park communities. Rather than investing all of the investors' moneys as represented, Biddlecome, without ever informing investors, transferred $4.5 million of the partnership's moneys to a brokerage account and engaged in day-trading, including trading options, trading on margin, and engaging in short sales. The complaint alleges that this risky day-trading strategy has resulted in erratic performance, alternating between six figure trading losses to profits in various months; in September and October 2009 alone, the account value declined $1.9 million. The complaint also alleges that the defendants falsely claimed that a brokerage firm would sell the partnership interests and an accounting firm would audit the partnership's books yearly. In addition, although investors were told distributions would be made quarterly out of net profits and certain investors received distributions, Homestead suffered losses for two years., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint charges the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 15(a) and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and names as relief defendants two entities controlled by Biddlecome, Homestead Northland MHC, LLC and Jackson MHC, L.L.C. The Commission alleges that the relief defendants received ill-gotten gains as a result of Biddlecome's conduct., \n",
       ", On November 16, 2009, the Honorable Cormac J. Carney, United States District Judge, granted the Commission's application for a temporary restraining order against the defendants and issued orders freezing Homestead's assets and prohibiting the destruction of documents. The Judge also appointed Robb Evans &amp; Associates LLC as the temporary receiver over Homestead. The Commission also seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties against the defendants., \n",

       ", SEC CHARGES CALIFORNIA TELECOM COMPANY WITH BRIBERY AND OTHER FCPA VIOLATIONS, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Alameda, Calif.-based telecommunications company UTStarcom, Inc. with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for authorizing unlawful payments to foreign government officials in Asia., \n",
       ", UTStarcom agreed to settle the SEC's charges and pay a $1.5 million penalty among other remedies. In a related criminal case, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today that UTStarcom agreed to pay an additional $1.5 million fine., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that UTStarcom's wholly-owned subsidiary in China paid nearly $7 million between 2002 and 2007 for hundreds of overseas trips by employees of Chinese government-controlled telecommunications companies that were customers of UTStarcom, purportedly to provide customer training. In reality, the trips were entirely or primarily for sightseeing., \n",
       ", The SEC further alleges that UTStarcom provided lavish gifts and all-expenses paid executive training programs in the U.S. for existing and potential foreign government customers in China and Thailand. UTStarcom also purported to hire individuals affiliated with foreign government customers to work in the U.S. and provided them with work visas, when in reality the individuals did no work for UTStarcom. According to the SEC, UTStarcom also made improper payments to sham consultants in China and Mongolia while knowing that they would pay bribes to foreign government officials., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges UTStarcom with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA (Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, respectively). UTStarcom agreed, without admitting or denying the charges, to the entry of a permanent injunction against FCPA violations and to provide the SEC with annual FCPA compliance reports and certifications for four years, in addition to paying the $1.5 million penalty., \n",

       ", Former Cendant Corporation Chairman Walter A. Forbes Settles SEC Fraud Action, \n",
       ", Text goes here, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) announced that on December 29, 2009, a settled final judgment was entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Walter A. Forbes, the former Chairman of Cendant Corporation (Cendant), in the Commission's action against Forbes arising out of his conduct in the Cendant fraud, Securities and Exchange Commission v. Walter A. Forbes et al., 01 civ 987 (JAP) (D.N.J. filed Feb. 28, 2001).  The Commission's complaint in that action alleged that Forbes orchestrated an earnings management scheme at CUC International Inc. (CUC), a corporate predecessor of Cendant, and, subsequently, at Cendant itself.  The complaint further alleged that over a twelve-year period Forbes directed a scheme that improperly inflated the company's quarterly and annual financial results, and that for the period 1995 to 1997, CUC's operating income was improperly inflated by an aggregate amount exceeding $500 million.  When the fraud was disclosed in 1998, Cendant's common stock dropped dramatically, resulting in defrauded investors losing billions of dollars., \n",
       ", The final judgment against Forbes, to which he consented without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b 5, 13b2 1, and 13b2 2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b 20, 13a 1, 13a 13, and 14a 9.  The final judgment also bars Forbes, pursuant to Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, from serving as an officer or director of a public company., \n",
       ", Forbes was convicted in a related federal criminal prosecution of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and making false filings with the Commission.  In 2007, Forbes was sentenced to 151 months in prison and ordered to pay criminal restitution of $3.275 billion.  Later that year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed his judgment of conviction.  In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Forbes' petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of his conviction.\n",

       ", SEC Charges Houston-Based Broker With Defrauding Florida Municipalties, \n",
       ", Text goes here, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Commission\") filed an action today charging a Houston-based broker with defrauding two Florida municipalities., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint alleges that Harold H. Jaschke (\"Jaschke\") reaped commissions of over $14 million by engaging in unauthorized and unsuitable trading on behalf of the City of Kissimmee, Fla. and the Tohopekaliga Water Authority (collectively, the \"Municipalities\"), and by churning their accounts.  While associated with the brokerage firm First Allied Securities, Inc., Jaschke lied to his customers about his fraudulent trading, which resulted in an aggregate, unrealized loss of approximately $60 million for a two year period., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Fla., alleges that Jaschke engaged in a high risk, short term trading strategy involving zero-coupon United States Treasury bonds, the value of which were very sensitive to interest rate changes.  For example, if interest rates were to increase by only 1%, the value of a 30-year bond would drop by 25%.  Jaschke's risky trading strategy involved buying and selling the same bond within a matter of days, and sometimes within the same day.  The complaint alleges that Jaschke exposed the Municipalities to greater risks when he leveraged their accounts using repurchase agreements.  Jaschke employed repurchase agreements to finance the bond purchases the Municipalities would not otherwise have been able to afford.  The complaint alleges this strategy dramatically increased the risks as Jaschke caused the Municipalities to borrow large sums of money to hold larger bond positions., \n",
       ", The complaint alleges Jaschke, age 49 of Houston, Tex., knew the Municipalities' ordinances prohibited his trading strategy as they required that their funds be invested with the paramount consideration to be safety of capital.  Further, the complaint alleges Jaschke knew that the Municipalities prohibited the use of repurchase agreements for investment.  According to the complaint, had the bond market not swung sharply in Jaschke's favor allowing the Municipalities to close their accounts with a modest profit, the Municipalities could have lost millions of dollars as a result of his misconduct., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint alleges that Jaschke violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of the broker-dealer books and records provisions, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-4(b)(4) thereunder.  The Commission's complaint seeks a permanent injunction and disgorgement with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty., \n",
       ", In a related action, the Commission instituted settled administrative proceedings against Jeffrey C. Young, First Allied's former vice president of supervision, for failing to reasonably supervise Jaschke.  The order found Young failed to respond adequately to red flags relating to Jaschke, and failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that First Allied's procedures regarding suitability were followed.  The Commission's order suspends Young from acting in a supervisory capacity for nine months and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  Young consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the Commission's findings.   For further information see , Exchange Act Release No. 34-61247, ., \n",

Taglieri, raised at least $14.3 million through the sale of unsecured notes to hundreds of Haitian-American investors by promising guaranteed returns of 100% every 90 days.  The defendants claimed they were able to generate such spectacular returns through. Bass’ purported successful trading of stock options and commodities.  The Commission’s complaint further alleged that, in reality, Bass traded no more than $1.2 million of the $14.3 million raised, generated trading losses of 19 percent, and that HomePals used the bulk of the investor funds to repay earlier investors in typical Ponzi scheme fashion., \n",

Tak, Defendants; and Homestead Northland MHC, LLC and Jackson MHC, L.L.C., Relief Defendants, , United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No. SACV 09-01331 CJC (filed Nov. 12, 2009)., \n",
       ", SEC OBTAINS PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION OVER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP MANAGED BY CULVER CITY ADVISER, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it obtained a preliminary injunction against Heath M. Biddlecome (\"Biddlecome\"), age 41, of Carpentaria, California, his firm California Wealth Management Group, doing business as IFC Advisory (\"IFC\"), of Culver City, California, a fund created by Biddlecome, Homestead Properties, L.P. (\"Homestead\"), the general partner of the fund, Homestead Limited L.L.C., and William C. Tak, age 43, of Newport Beach, California, to halt the continuing false disclosures being made by Homestead, Biddlecome, and Tak. The Honorable Cormac J. Carney, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, also granted additional relief that the Commission sought including orders freezing assets, and appointing Robb Evans & Associates LLC as permanent receiver over Homestead., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint, filed November 12, in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Biddlecome established Homestead to invest in mobile home park communities. Rather than investing all of the investors' moneys as represented, Biddlecome, without ever informing investors, transferred $4.5 million of the partnership's moneys to a brokerage account and engaged in day-trading, including trading options, trading on margin, and engaging in short sales. The complaint alleges that this risky day-trading strategy has resulted in erratic performance, alternating between six figure trading losses to profits in various months; in September and October 2009 alone, the account value declined $1.9 million. The complaint also alleges that the defendants falsely claimed that a brokerage firm would sell the partnership interests and an accounting firm would audit the partnership's books yearly. In addition, although investors were told distributions would be made quarterly out of net profits and certain investors received distributions, Homestead suffered losses for two years., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint charges the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 15(a) and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and names as relief defendants two entities controlled by Biddlecome, Homestead Northland MHC, LLC and Jackson MHC, L.L.C. The Commission alleges that the relief defendants received ill-gotten gains as a result of Biddlecome's conduct., \n",
       ", On November 16, 2009, the Honorable Cormac J. Carney, United States District Judge, granted the Commission's application for a temporary restraining order against the defendants and issued orders freezing Homestead's assets and prohibiting the destruction of documents. The Judge also appointed Robb Evans & Associates LLC as the temporary receiver over Homestead. The Commission also seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties against the defendants., \n",

       ", Former Cendant Corporation Chairman Walter A. Forbes Settles SEC Fraud Action, \n",
       ", Text goes here, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) announced that on December 29, 2009, a settled final judgment was entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Walter A. Forbes, the former Chairman of Cendant Corporation (Cendant), in the Commission's action against Forbes arising out of his conduct in the Cendant fraud, Securities and Exchange Commission v. Walter A. Forbes et al., 01 civ 987 (JAP) (D.N.J. filed Feb. 28, 2001).  The Commission's complaint in that action alleged that Forbes orchestrated an earnings management scheme at CUC International Inc. (CUC), a corporate predecessor of Cendant, and, subsequently, at Cendant itself.  The complaint further alleged that over a twelve-year period Forbes directed a scheme that improperly inflated the company's quarterly and annual financial results, and that for the period 1995 to 1997, CUC's operating income was improperly inflated by an aggregate amount exceeding $500 million.  When the fraud was disclosed in 1998, Cendant's common stock dropped dramatically, resulting in defrauded investors losing billions of dollars., \n",
       ", The final judgment against Forbes, to which he consented without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b 5, 13b2 1, and 13b2 2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b 20, 13a 1, 13a 13, and 14a 9.  The final judgment also bars Forbes, pursuant to Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, from serving as an officer or director of a public company., \n",
       ", Forbes was convicted in a related federal criminal prosecution of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and making false filings with the Commission.  In 2007, Forbes was sentenced to 151 months in prison and ordered to pay criminal restitution of $3.275 billion.  Later that year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed his judgment of conviction.  In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Forbes' petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of his conviction.\n",

       ", SEC Charges Houston-Based Broker With Defrauding Florida Municipalties, \n",
       ", Text goes here, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Commission\") filed an action today charging a Houston-based broker with defrauding two Florida municipalities., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint alleges that Harold H. Jaschke (\"Jaschke\") reaped commissions of over $14 million by engaging in unauthorized and unsuitable trading on behalf of the City of Kissimmee, Fla. and the Tohopekaliga Water Authority (collectively, the \"Municipalities\"), and by churning their accounts.  While associated with the brokerage firm First Allied Securities, Inc., Jaschke lied to his customers about his fraudulent trading, which resulted in an aggregate, unrealized loss of approximately $60 million for a two year period., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Fla., alleges that Jaschke engaged in a high risk, short term trading strategy involving zero-coupon United States Treasury bonds, the value of which were very sensitive to interest rate changes.  For example, if interest rates were to increase by only 1%, the value of a 30-year bond would drop by 25%.  Jaschke's risky trading strategy involved buying and selling the same bond within a matter of days, and sometimes within the same day.  The complaint alleges that Jaschke exposed the Municipalities to greater risks when he leveraged their accounts using repurchase agreements.  Jaschke employed repurchase agreements to finance the bond purchases the Municipalities would not otherwise have been able to afford.  The complaint alleges this strategy dramatically increased the risks as Jaschke caused the Municipalities to borrow large sums of money to hold larger bond positions., \n",
       ", The complaint alleges Jaschke, age 49 of Houston, Tex., knew the Municipalities' ordinances prohibited his trading strategy as they required that their funds be invested with the paramount consideration to be safety of capital.  Further, the complaint alleges Jaschke knew that the Municipalities prohibited the use of repurchase agreements for investment.  According to the complaint, had the bond market not swung sharply in Jaschke's favor allowing the Municipalities to close their accounts with a modest profit, the Municipalities could have lost millions of dollars as a result of his misconduct., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint alleges that Jaschke violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of the broker-dealer books and records provisions, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-4(b)(4) thereunder.  The Commission's complaint seeks a permanent injunction and disgorgement with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty., \n",
       ", In a related action, the Commission instituted settled administrative proceedings against Jeffrey C. Young, First Allied's former vice president of supervision, for failing to reasonably supervise Jaschke.  The order found Young failed to respond adequately to red flags relating to Jaschke, and failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that First Allied's procedures regarding suitability were followed.  The Commission's order suspends Young from acting in a supervisory capacity for nine months and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  Young consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the Commission's findings.   For further information see , Exchange Act Release No. 34-61247, ., \n",

       ", The Commission announced that on December 21, 2009, the Honorable Kenneth L. Ryskamp, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of Florida, entered a default judgment of permanent injunction and other relief against Defendants Ronnie Eugene Bass (Bass), HomePals, LLC and HomePals Investment Club, LLC (collectively HomePals). Bass and HomePals defaulted by failing to appear, answer or otherwise plead in response to the Commission's complaint.  The default judgment permanently enjoins Bass and HomePals from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the default judgment enjoins Bass from future violations of Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8., \n",
       ", On October 16, 2009, the Commission filed its complaint against Bass, HomePals and others alleging that they ran a Ponzi scheme and affinity fraud that targeted Haitian-American investors residing primarily in South Florida.  The Commission’s complaint alleged that from April 2008 through December 2008, HomePals, and their principals, Bass, Abner Alabre and Brian J. Taglieri, raised at least $14.3 million through the sale of unsecured notes to hundreds of Haitian-American investors by promising guaranteed returns of 100% every 90 days.  The defendants claimed they were able to generate such spectacular returns through. Bass’ purported successful trading of stock options and commodities.  The Commission’s complaint further alleged that, in reality, Bass traded no more than $1.2 million of the $14.3 million raised, generated trading losses of 19 percent, and that HomePals used the bulk of the investor funds to repay earlier investors in typical Ponzi scheme fashion., \n",

       ", The Commission's complaint, filed November 12, in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Biddlecome established Homestead to invest in mobile home park communities. Rather than investing all of the investors' moneys as represented, Biddlecome, without ever informing investors, transferred $4.5 million of the partnership's moneys to a brokerage account and engaged in day-trading, including trading options, trading on margin, and engaging in short sales. The complaint alleges that this risky day-trading strategy has resulted in erratic performance, alternating between six figure trading losses to profits in various months; in September and October 2009 alone, the account value declined $1.9 million. The complaint also alleges that the defendants falsely claimed that a brokerage firm would sell the partnership interests and an accounting firm would audit the partnership's books yearly. In addition, although investors were told distributions would be made quarterly out of net profits and certain investors received distributions, Homestead suffered losses for two years., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint charges the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 15(a) and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and names as relief defendants two entities controlled by Biddlecome, Homestead Northland MHC, LLC and Jackson MHC, L.L.C.

       ", On November 16, 2009, the Honorable Cormac J. Carney, United States District Judge, granted the Commission's application for a temporary restraining order against the defendants and issued orders freezing Homestead's assets and prohibiting the destruction of documents. The Judge also appointed Robb Evans &amp; Associates LLC as the temporary receiver over Homestead.

       ", SEC CHARGES CALIFORNIA TELECOM COMPANY WITH BRIBERY AND OTHER FCPA VIOLATIONS, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Alameda, Calif.-based telecommunications company UTStarcom, Inc. with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for authorizing unlawful payments to foreign government officials in Asia., \n",
       ", UTStarcom agreed to settle the SEC's charges and pay a $1.5 million penalty among other remedies. In a related criminal case, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today that UTStarcom agreed to pay an additional $1.5 million fine., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that UTStarcom's wholly-owned subsidiary in China paid nearly $7 million between 2002 and 2007 for hundreds of overseas trips by employees of Chinese government-controlled telecommunications companies that were customers of UTStarcom, purportedly to provide customer training. In reality, the trips were entirely or primarily for sightseeing., \n",
       ", The SEC further alleges that UTStarcom provided lavish gifts and all-expenses paid executive training programs in the U.S. for existing and potential foreign government customers in China and Thailand. UTStarcom also purported to hire individuals affiliated with foreign government customers to work in the U.S. and provided them with work visas, when in reality the individuals did no work for UTStarcom. According to the SEC, UTStarcom also made improper payments to sham consultants in China and Mongolia while knowing that they would pay bribes to foreign government officials., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges UTStarcom with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA (Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, respectively). UTStarcom agreed, without admitting or denying the charges, to the entry of a permanent injunction against FCPA violations and to provide the SEC with annual FCPA compliance reports and certifications for four years, in addition to paying the $1.5 million penalty., \n",

       ", Former Cendant Corporation Chairman Walter A. Forbes Settles SEC Fraud Action, \n",
       ", Text goes here, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) announced that on December 29, 2009, a settled final judgment was entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Walter A. Forbes, the former Chairman of Cendant Corporation (Cendant), in the Commission's action against Forbes arising out of his conduct in the Cendant fraud, Securities and Exchange Commission v. Walter A. Forbes et al., 01 civ 987 (JAP) (D.N.J. filed Feb. 28, 2001).  The Commission's complaint in that action alleged that Forbes orchestrated an earnings management scheme at CUC International Inc. (CUC), a corporate predecessor of Cendant, and, subsequently, at Cendant itself.  The complaint further alleged that over a twelve-year period Forbes directed a scheme that improperly inflated the company's quarterly and annual financial results, and that for the period 1995 to 1997, CUC's operating income was improperly inflated by an aggregate amount exceeding $500 million.  When the fraud was disclosed in 1998, Cendant's common stock dropped dramatically, resulting in defrauded investors losing billions of dollars., \n",
       ", The final judgment against Forbes, to which he consented without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, enjoins him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and Exchange Act Rules 10b 5, 13b2 1, and 13b2 2, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b 20, 13a 1, 13a 13, and 14a 9.  The final judgment also bars Forbes, pursuant to Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, from serving as an officer or director of a public company., \n",
       ", Forbes was convicted in a related federal criminal prosecution of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and making false filings with the Commission.  In 2007, Forbes was sentenced to 151 months in prison and ordered to pay criminal restitution of $3.275 billion.  Later that year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed his judgment of conviction.  In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Forbes' petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of his conviction.\n",

       ", SEC Charges Houston-Based Broker With Defrauding Florida Municipalties, \n",
       ", Text goes here, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Commission\") filed an action today charging a Houston-based broker with defrauding two Florida municipalities., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint alleges that Harold H. Jaschke (\"Jaschke\") reaped commissions of over $14 million by engaging in unauthorized and unsuitable trading on behalf of the City of Kissimmee, Fla. and the Tohopekaliga Water Authority (collectively, the \"Municipalities\"), and by churning their accounts.  While associated with the brokerage firm First Allied Securities, Inc., Jaschke lied to his customers about his fraudulent trading, which resulted in an aggregate, unrealized loss of approximately $60 million for a two year period., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Fla., alleges that Jaschke engaged in a high risk, short term trading strategy involving zero-coupon United States Treasury bonds, the value of which were very sensitive to interest rate changes.  For example, if interest rates were to increase by only 1%, the value of a 30-year bond would drop by 25%.  Jaschke's risky trading strategy involved buying and selling the same bond within a matter of days, and sometimes within the same day.  The complaint alleges that Jaschke exposed the Municipalities to greater risks when he leveraged their accounts using repurchase agreements.  Jaschke employed repurchase agreements to finance the bond purchases the Municipalities would not otherwise have been able to afford.  The complaint alleges this strategy dramatically increased the risks as Jaschke caused the Municipalities to borrow large sums of money to hold larger bond positions., \n",
       ", The complaint alleges Jaschke, age 49 of Houston, Tex., knew the Municipalities' ordinances prohibited his trading strategy as they required that their funds be invested with the paramount consideration to be safety of capital.  Further, the complaint alleges Jaschke knew that the Municipalities prohibited the use of repurchase agreements for investment.  According to the complaint, had the bond market not swung sharply in Jaschke's favor allowing the Municipalities to close their accounts with a modest profit, the Municipalities could have lost millions of dollars as a result of his misconduct., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint alleges that Jaschke violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations of the broker-dealer books and records provisions, Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-4(b)(4) thereunder.  The Commission's complaint seeks a permanent injunction and disgorgement with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty., \n",
       ", In a related action, the Commission instituted settled administrative proceedings against Jeffrey C. Young, First Allied's former vice president of supervision, for failing to reasonably supervise Jaschke.  The order found Young failed to respond adequately to red flags relating to Jaschke, and failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that First Allied's procedures regarding suitability were followed.  The Commission's order suspends Young from acting in a supervisory capacity for nine months and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  Young consented to the entry of the order without admitting or denying the Commission's findings.   For further information see , Exchange Act Release No. 34-61247, ., \n",

       ", The Commission announced that on December 21, 2009, the Honorable Kenneth L. Ryskamp, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of Florida, entered a default judgment of permanent injunction and other relief against Defendants Ronnie Eugene Bass (Bass), HomePals, LLC and HomePals Investment Club, LLC (collectively HomePals). Bass and HomePals defaulted by failing to appear, answer or otherwise plead in response to the Commission's complaint.  The default judgment permanently enjoins Bass and HomePals from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the default judgment enjoins Bass from future violations of Sections 206(1), (2) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8., \n",
       ", On October 16, 2009, the Commission filed its complaint against Bass, HomePals and others alleging that they ran a Ponzi scheme and affinity fraud that targeted Haitian-American investors residing primarily in South Florida.  The Commission’s complaint alleged that from April 2008 through December 2008, HomePals, and their principals, Bass, Abner Alabre and Brian J. Taglieri, raised at least $14.3 million through the sale of unsecured notes to hundreds of Haitian-American investors by promising guaranteed returns of 100% every 90 days.  The defendants claimed they were able to generate such spectacular returns through. Bass’ purported successful trading of stock options and commodities.  The Commission’s complaint further alleged that, in reality, Bass traded no more than $1.2 million of the $14.3 million raised, generated trading losses of 19 percent, and that HomePals used the bulk of the investor funds to repay earlier investors in typical Ponzi scheme fashion., \n",

       ", Securities and Exchange Commission v. Homestead Properties, L.P.; Homestead Limited, L.L.C.; California Wealth Management Group, d.b.a. IFC Advisory; Heath M. Biddlecome; William C. Tak, Defendants; and Homestead Northland MHC, LLC and Jackson MHC, L.L.C., Relief Defendants, , United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No. SACV 09-01331 CJC (filed Nov. 12, 2009)., \n",
       ", SEC OBTAINS PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION OVER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP MANAGED BY CULVER CITY ADVISER, \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it obtained a preliminary injunction against Heath M. Biddlecome (\"Biddlecome\"), age 41, of Carpentaria, California, his firm California Wealth Management Group, doing business as IFC Advisory (\"IFC\"), of Culver City, California, a fund created by Biddlecome, Homestead Properties, L.P. (\"Homestead\"), the general partner of the fund, Homestead Limited L.L.C., and William C. Tak, age 43, of Newport Beach, California, to halt the continuing false disclosures being made by Homestead, Biddlecome, and Tak. The Honorable Cormac J. Carney, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, also granted additional relief that the Commission sought including orders freezing assets, and appointing Robb Evans & Associates LLC as permanent receiver over Homestead., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint, filed November 12, in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Biddlecome established Homestead to invest in mobile home park communities. Rather than investing all of the investors' moneys as represented, Biddlecome, without ever informing investors, transferred $4.5 million of the partnership's moneys to a brokerage account and engaged in day-trading, including trading options, trading on margin, and engaging in short sales. The complaint alleges that this risky day-trading strategy has resulted in erratic performance, alternating between six figure trading losses to profits in various months; in September and October 2009 alone, the account value declined $1.9 million. The complaint also alleges that the defendants falsely claimed that a brokerage firm would sell the partnership interests and an accounting firm would audit the partnership's books yearly. In addition, although investors were told distributions would be made quarterly out of net profits and certain investors received distributions, Homestead suffered losses for two years., \n",
       ", The Commission's complaint charges the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 15(a) and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 204, 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and names as relief defendants two entities controlled by Biddlecome, Homestead Northland MHC, LLC and Jackson MHC, L.L.C. The Commission alleges that the relief defendants received ill-gotten gains as a result of Biddlecome's conduct., \n",
       ", On November 16, 2009, the Honorable Cormac J. Carney, United States District Judge, granted the Commission's application for a temporary restraining order against the defendants and issued orders freezing Homestead's assets and prohibiting the destruction of documents. The Judge also appointed Robb Evans & Associates LLC as the temporary receiver over Homestead. The Commission also seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties against the defendants., \n",
