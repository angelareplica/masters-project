       ", SEC Charges Attorney and Accountant with Aiding and Abetting Adviser's $9 Million Theft from Charity Client, Adviser Settles Related Fraud Claims, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today charged New York-based investment advisor Train Babcock Advisors LLC (\"TBA\"), a New Jersey-based attorney, and a New York-based accountant, in connection with a fraudulent scheme led by TBA's former principal, John Rogicki, who stole more than $9 million from his advisory client, a charitable foundation established by an elderly widow to donate her estate to health and education causes., \n",
       ", TBA, which is in the process of winding down its operations, has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by paying more than $1.7 million in disgorgement, interest, and penalties for these and other violations.  TBA has also agreed to be censured and to withdraw its registration with the SEC as an investment advisor., \n",
       ", Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan against one of the foundation's trustees, attorney Robert Gaughran, and its accountant, Kevin Clune, alleging that they aided and abetted the fraud perpetrated by TBA and Rogicki, the foundation's investment adviser, President, and a trustee., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's filings, between 2004 and 2016, Rogicki took advantage of his roles as investment adviser and trustee to the foundation by liquidating securities positions in the foundation's advisory account with TBA and misappropriating a total of more than $9 million from the foundation for his own personal benefit.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Gaughran and Clune aided and abetted TBA's and Rogicki's fraudulent scheme.  While serving as a trustee of the foundation, Gaughran allegedly accepted outsized fees and ignored glaring signs of Rogicki's theft that were apparent from the foundation's brokerage statements and other documents that he regularly reviewed.  Gaughran also drafted the trust and estate papers that put Rogicki in charge of the charitable foundation and knew the size of the estate that should have flowed to the charitable foundation, but for Rogicki's misappropriation of $9 million of its assets.  According to the SEC's complaint, Clune, an accountant who performed tax work for both the estate that created the charitable foundation and the charitable foundation itself, ignored multiple and repeated red flags revealing Rogicki's and TBA's fraudulent scheme.  In addition, both Gaughran and Clune were actively involved in concealing the theft by providing false information to an outside audit firm during a surprise examination of the charitable foundation that was conducted in 2014., \n",
       ", On October 19, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court against Rogicki.  In a parallel criminal action, Rogicki pleaded guilty to criminal charges brought against him by the Manhattan District Attorney on October 19, 2017.  On December 14, 2017, Rogicki was sentenced to serve 30 to 90 months in prison and ordered to pay $6,728,391.77 to the foundation, of which he forfeited $2.5 million, in connection with his criminal plea.  The SEC also previously instituted administrative proceedings against former TBA CEO Brian J. Keenan on September 26, 2017, in connection with his misappropriation of assets from a separate client account.  The administrative proceedings against Keenan were settled on October 23, 2017., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Gaughran and Clune with aiding and abetting TBA's and Rogicki's violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and penalties against Gaughran and Clune., \n",
       ", The SEC's order instituting settled administrative proceedings against TBA finds that the adviser failed to detect and prevent two separate misappropriations by its former principals from client accounts for which TBA's former principals acted as trustee and over which TBA had custody.  TBA also failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 206(4)-2 under the Advisers Act by neglecting to obtain surprise examinations for several years for certain client accounts for which it had custody.  The SEC's order also finds that TBA filed numerous Forms ADV containing false information.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, TBA consented to entry of a cease-and-desist order, a censure, and to pay disgorgement, interest, and a penalty of over $1.7 million.  TBA also agreed to file a Form ADV/W withdrawing its registration with the Commission at the completion of its wind-down., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Katherine Bromberg, Jon Daniels, Neil Hendelman, Dugan Bliss, and Valerie A. Szczepanik of the New York Regional Office.  The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.  The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Bliss, Ms. Bromberg, and Mr. Daniels.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by investment adviser examiners in the New York Regional Office.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office., \n",

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that, on December 19, 2017, Judge Alison J. Nathan of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued an order finding Anvil Partners, Inc., a Buffalo, New York investment adviser registered with the SEC, and its majority owner, president, and chief investment officer, Jeremy Beck, to be in civil contempt of court for failing to comply with the court's prior order enforcing an SEC investigative subpoena directed to Anvil., \n",
       ", The SEC is investigating, among other things, whether Anvil materially overstated its assets under management in its public filings.  On June 6, 2017, the SEC issued an investigative subpoena to Anvil requiring that it produce certain documents.  However, Anvil failed to produce any documents or otherwise respond to the subpoena., \n",
       ", The SEC filed this subpoena enforcement action on August 21, 2017, and on September 21, 2017, the court entered an order requiring Anvil to comply with the SEC subpoena. Anvil failed to comply with the court's order, and, after holding a hearing on December 19, 2017, the court held Anvil and Beck in civil contempt. The contempt order requires Anvil and Beck to reimburse the SEC the costs of serving them with court papers in this proceeding, imposes a $250 daily fine against both Anvil and Beck until Anvil complies with the subpoena enforcement order, and orders Beck's arrest and appearance at a further January 10, 2018 hearing., \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges and an asset freeze against a group of unregistered funds and their owner who allegedly bilked thousands of retail investors, many of them seniors, in a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme., \n",
       ", SEC investigators filed this action to prevent further dissipation of investor assets after obtaining court orders in September and November in subpoena enforcement actions that forced the unregistered companies to open their books., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, unsealed today in federal court in Miami, Florida, Robert H. Shapiro and a group of unregistered investment companies called the Woodbridge Group of Companies LLC, listed below, formerly headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, defrauded more than 8,400 investors in unregistered Woodbridge funds. , \n",
       ", According to the SEC complaint, Woodbridge advertised its primary business as issuing loans to supposed third-party commercial property owners paying Woodbridge 11-15% annual interest for \"hard money,\" short-term financing.  In return, Woodbridge allegedly promised to pay investors 5-10 percent interest annually.  Woodbridge and Shapiro allegedly sought to avoid investors cashing out at the end of their terms and boasted in marketing materials that \"clients keep coming back to [Woodbridge] because time and experience have proven results.  Over 90% national renewal rate!\" While Woodbridge claimed it made high-interest loans to third parties, the SEC's complaint alleges that the vast majority of the borrowers were Shapiro-owned companies that had no income and never repaid the loans., \n",
       ", The SEC complaint alleges that Shapiro and Woodbridge used investors' money to pay other investors, and paid $64.5 million in commissions to sales agents who pitched the investments as \"low risk\" and \"conservative.\"  Shapiro, of Sherman Oaks, California, is alleged to have diverted at least $21 million for his own benefit, including to charter planes, pay country club fees, and buy luxury vehicles and jewelry.  According to the complaint, the scheme collapsed in typical Ponzi fashion in early December as Woodbridge stopped paying investors and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection., \n",
       ", The Honorable Judge Marcia G. Cooke granted the SEC's request for a temporary asset freeze against Shapiro and a group of his unregistered investment companies, and ordered them to provide an accounting of all money received from investors., \n",

Peters allegedly claimed that the VisionQuest Capital notes presented little or no risk of loss and were \"guaranteed.\", \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, investor funds were not used as Peters claimed.  Peters allegedly spent at least $4.4 million on such personal endeavors as remodeling a large farm in North Carolina, purchasing fine art for his home, and constructing a vacation home in Costa Rica.  Peters also spent at least $4.9 million to make Ponzi payments to earlier investors., \n",
       ", In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against Peters, including a charge that alleges that Peters attempted to withhold and conceal records from the SEC, fabricated records, and provided false testimony in the SEC's investigation of Peters' scheme., \n",

According to the SEC's complaint, Mitsakos and Matrix then stole money from the first client who invested with them based on their misrepresentations., \n",
       ", On December 4, 2017, the Honorable Paul Oetken of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, entered final judgments permanently enjoining Matrix, Mitsakos and Holt-Nguyen from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The court ordered Matrix and Mitsakos to pay disgorgement of $861,163.62, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $57,474.30, which is deemed satisfied by the $861,163.62 in restitution and $861,163.62 in forfeiture ordered against Mitsakos in a parallel criminal action.  The court also imposed an officer and director bar against Mitsakos and ordered Holt-Nguyen to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  In separate administrative proceedings, instituted December 19, 2017, Mitsakos agreed to be barred from the securities industry and from participating in penny stock offerings, Matrix agreed to be censured.  Holt-Nguyen agreed to an industry bar with the right to apply for reentry after three years, but which permits him to continue his current employment with an investment adviser, limiting him to providing only information technology and administrative functions., \n",

       ", SEC Charges Attorney and Accountant with Aiding and Abetting Adviser's $9 Million Theft from Charity Client, Adviser Settles Related Fraud Claims, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today charged New York-based investment advisor Train Babcock Advisors LLC (\"TBA\"), a New Jersey-based attorney, and a New York-based accountant, in connection with a fraudulent scheme led by TBA's former principal, John Rogicki, who stole more than $9 million from his advisory client, a charitable foundation established by an elderly widow to donate her estate to health and education causes., \n",
       ", TBA, which is in the process of winding down its operations, has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by paying more than $1.7 million in disgorgement, interest, and penalties for these and other violations.  TBA has also agreed to be censured and to withdraw its registration with the SEC as an investment advisor., \n",
       ", Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan against one of the foundation's trustees, attorney Robert Gaughran, and its accountant, Kevin Clune, alleging that they aided and abetted the fraud perpetrated by TBA and Rogicki, the foundation's investment adviser, President, and a trustee., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's filings, between 2004 and 2016, Rogicki took advantage of his roles as investment adviser and trustee to the foundation by liquidating securities positions in the foundation's advisory account with TBA and misappropriating a total of more than $9 million from the foundation for his own personal benefit.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Gaughran and Clune aided and abetted TBA's and Rogicki's fraudulent scheme.  While serving as a trustee of the foundation, Gaughran allegedly accepted outsized fees and ignored glaring signs of Rogicki's theft that were apparent from the foundation's brokerage statements and other documents that he regularly reviewed.  Gaughran also drafted the trust and estate papers that put Rogicki in charge of the charitable foundation and knew the size of the estate that should have flowed to the charitable foundation, but for Rogicki's misappropriation of $9 million of its assets.  According to the SEC's complaint, Clune, an accountant who performed tax work for both the estate that created the charitable foundation and the charitable foundation itself, ignored multiple and repeated red flags revealing Rogicki's and TBA's fraudulent scheme.  In addition, both Gaughran and Clune were actively involved in concealing the theft by providing false information to an outside audit firm during a surprise examination of the charitable foundation that was conducted in 2014., \n",
       ", On October 19, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court against Rogicki.  In a parallel criminal action, Rogicki pleaded guilty to criminal charges brought against him by the Manhattan District Attorney on October 19, 2017.  On December 14, 2017, Rogicki was sentenced to serve 30 to 90 months in prison and ordered to pay $6,728,391.77 to the foundation, of which he forfeited $2.5 million, in connection with his criminal plea.  The SEC also previously instituted administrative proceedings against former TBA CEO Brian J. Keenan on September 26, 2017, in connection with his misappropriation of assets from a separate client account.  The administrative proceedings against Keenan were settled on October 23, 2017., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Gaughran and Clune with aiding and abetting TBA's and Rogicki's violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and penalties against Gaughran and Clune., \n",
       ", The SEC's order instituting settled administrative proceedings against TBA finds that the adviser failed to detect and prevent two separate misappropriations by its former principals from client accounts for which TBA's former principals acted as trustee and over which TBA had custody.  TBA also failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 206(4)-2 under the Advisers Act by neglecting to obtain surprise examinations for several years for certain client accounts for which it had custody.  The SEC's order also finds that TBA filed numerous Forms ADV containing false information.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, TBA consented to entry of a cease-and-desist order, a censure, and to pay disgorgement, interest, and a penalty of over $1.7 million.  TBA also agreed to file a Form ADV/W withdrawing its registration with the Commission at the completion of its wind-down., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Katherine Bromberg, Jon Daniels, Neil Hendelman, Dugan Bliss, and Valerie A. Szczepanik of the New York Regional Office.  The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.  The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Bliss, Ms. Bromberg, and Mr. Daniels.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by investment adviser examiners in the New York Regional Office.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office., \n",

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that, on December 19, 2017, Judge Alison J. Nathan of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued an order finding Anvil Partners, Inc., a Buffalo, New York investment adviser registered with the SEC, and its majority owner, president, and chief investment officer, Jeremy Beck, to be in civil contempt of court for failing to comply with the court's prior order enforcing an SEC investigative subpoena directed to Anvil., \n",
       ", The SEC is investigating, among other things, whether Anvil materially overstated its assets under management in its public filings.  On June 6, 2017, the SEC issued an investigative subpoena to Anvil requiring that it produce certain documents.  However, Anvil failed to produce any documents or otherwise respond to the subpoena., \n",
       ", The SEC filed this subpoena enforcement action on August 21, 2017, and on September 21, 2017, the court entered an order requiring Anvil to comply with the SEC subpoena. Anvil failed to comply with the court's order, and, after holding a hearing on December 19, 2017, the court held Anvil and Beck in civil contempt. The contempt order requires Anvil and Beck to reimburse the SEC the costs of serving them with court papers in this proceeding, imposes a $250 daily fine against both Anvil and Beck until Anvil complies with the subpoena enforcement order, and orders Beck's arrest and appearance at a further January 10, 2018 hearing., \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges and an asset freeze against a group of unregistered funds and their owner who allegedly bilked thousands of retail investors, many of them seniors, in a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme., \n",
       ", SEC investigators filed this action to prevent further dissipation of investor assets after obtaining court orders in September and November in subpoena enforcement actions that forced the unregistered companies to open their books., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, unsealed today in federal court in Miami, Florida, Robert H. Shapiro and a group of unregistered investment companies called the Woodbridge Group of Companies LLC, listed below, formerly headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, defrauded more than 8,400 investors in unregistered Woodbridge funds. , \n",
       ", According to the SEC complaint, Woodbridge advertised its primary business as issuing loans to supposed third-party commercial property owners paying Woodbridge 11-15% annual interest for \"hard money,\" short-term financing.  In return, Woodbridge allegedly promised to pay investors 5-10 percent interest annually.  Woodbridge and Shapiro allegedly sought to avoid investors cashing out at the end of their terms and boasted in marketing materials that \"clients keep coming back to [Woodbridge] because time and experience have proven results.  Over 90% national renewal rate!\" While Woodbridge claimed it made high-interest loans to third parties, the SEC's complaint alleges that the vast majority of the borrowers were Shapiro-owned companies that had no income and never repaid the loans., \n",
       ", The SEC complaint alleges that Shapiro and Woodbridge used investors' money to pay other investors, and paid $64.5 million in commissions to sales agents who pitched the investments as \"low risk\" and \"conservative.\"  Shapiro, of Sherman Oaks, California, is alleged to have diverted at least $21 million for his own benefit, including to charter planes, pay country club fees, and buy luxury vehicles and jewelry.  According to the complaint, the scheme collapsed in typical Ponzi fashion in early December as Woodbridge stopped paying investors and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection., \n",
       ", The Honorable Judge Marcia G. Cooke granted the SEC's request for a temporary asset freeze against Shapiro and a group of his unregistered investment companies, and ordered them to provide an accounting of all money received from investors., \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Raleigh, North Carolina-based investment adviser with running a Ponzi scheme that primarily targeted his clients, many of whom were retired and elderly., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that Stephen C. Peters, through his investment adviser firm VisionQuest Wealth Management, sold promissory notes issued by another one of his companies, VisionQuest Capital, to clients and other prospective investors while making false statements, including that proceeds would be invested into revenue-producing businesses with neither Peters nor his businesses receiving compensation.  Peters allegedly claimed that the VisionQuest Capital notes presented little or no risk of loss and were \"guaranteed.\", \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, investor funds were not used as Peters claimed.  Peters allegedly spent at least $4.4 million on such personal endeavors as remodeling a large farm in North Carolina, purchasing fine art for his home, and constructing a vacation home in Costa Rica.  Peters also spent at least $4.9 million to make Ponzi payments to earlier investors., \n",
       ", In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against Peters, including a charge that alleges that Peters attempted to withhold and conceal records from the SEC, fabricated records, and provided false testimony in the SEC's investigation of Peters' scheme., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges Peters, VisionQuest Wealth Management, LLC, VisionQuest Capital, LLC, and VQ Wealth, LLC, with violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission obtained final judgements against Matrix Capital Markets, LLC, Nicholas M. Mitsakos, and Courtlin L. Holt-Nguyen, all charged by the SEC for pretending to manage millions of dollars in assets and fabricating a hypothetical portfolio of investments that purportedly earned returns of 20 to 66 percent.  According to the SEC's complaint, Mitsakos and Matrix then stole money from the first client who invested with them based on their misrepresentations., \n",
       ", On December 4, 2017, the Honorable Paul Oetken of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, entered final judgments permanently enjoining Matrix, Mitsakos and Holt-Nguyen from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The court ordered Matrix and Mitsakos to pay disgorgement of $861,163.62, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $57,474.30, which is deemed satisfied by the $861,163.62 in restitution and $861,163.62 in forfeiture ordered against Mitsakos in a parallel criminal action.  The court also imposed an officer and director bar against Mitsakos and ordered Holt-Nguyen to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  In separate administrative proceedings, instituted December 19, 2017, Mitsakos agreed to be barred from the securities industry and from participating in penny stock offerings, Matrix agreed to be censured.  Holt-Nguyen agreed to an industry bar with the right to apply for reentry after three years, but which permits him to continue his current employment with an investment adviser, limiting him to providing only information technology and administrative functions., \n",

       ", SEC Charges Attorney and Accountant with Aiding and Abetting Adviser's $9 Million Theft from Charity Client, Adviser Settles Related Fraud Claims, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today charged New York-based investment advisor Train Babcock Advisors LLC (\"TBA\"), a New Jersey-based attorney, and a New York-based accountant, in connection with a fraudulent scheme led by TBA's former principal, John Rogicki, who stole more than $9 million from his advisory client, a charitable foundation established by an elderly widow to donate her estate to health and education causes., \n",
       ", TBA, which is in the process of winding down its operations, has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by paying more than $1.7 million in disgorgement, interest, and penalties for these and other violations.  TBA has also agreed to be censured and to withdraw its registration with the SEC as an investment advisor., \n",
       ", Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan against one of the foundation's trustees, attorney Robert Gaughran, and its accountant, Kevin Clune, alleging that they aided and abetted the fraud perpetrated by TBA and Rogicki, the foundation's investment adviser, President, and a trustee., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's filings, between 2004 and 2016, Rogicki took advantage of his roles as investment adviser and trustee to the foundation by liquidating securities positions in the foundation's advisory account with TBA and misappropriating a total of more than $9 million from the foundation for his own personal benefit.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Gaughran and Clune aided and abetted TBA's and Rogicki's fraudulent scheme.  While serving as a trustee of the foundation, Gaughran allegedly accepted outsized fees and ignored glaring signs of Rogicki's theft that were apparent from the foundation's brokerage statements and other documents that he regularly reviewed.  Gaughran also drafted the trust and estate papers that put Rogicki in charge of the charitable foundation and knew the size of the estate that should have flowed to the charitable foundation, but for Rogicki's misappropriation of $9 million of its assets.  According to the SEC's complaint, Clune, an accountant who performed tax work for both the estate that created the charitable foundation and the charitable foundation itself, ignored multiple and repeated red flags revealing Rogicki's and TBA's fraudulent scheme.  In addition, both Gaughran and Clune were actively involved in concealing the theft by providing false information to an outside audit firm during a surprise examination of the charitable foundation that was conducted in 2014., \n",
       ", On October 19, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court against Rogicki.  In a parallel criminal action, Rogicki pleaded guilty to criminal charges brought against him by the Manhattan District Attorney on October 19, 2017.  On December 14, 2017, Rogicki was sentenced to serve 30 to 90 months in prison and ordered to pay $6,728,391.77 to the foundation, of which he forfeited $2.5 million, in connection with his criminal plea.  The SEC also previously instituted administrative proceedings against former TBA CEO Brian J. Keenan on September 26, 2017, in connection with his misappropriation of assets from a separate client account.  The administrative proceedings against Keenan were settled on October 23, 2017., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Gaughran and Clune with aiding and abetting TBA's and Rogicki's violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and penalties against Gaughran and Clune., \n",
       ", The SEC's order instituting settled administrative proceedings against TBA finds that the adviser failed to detect and prevent two separate misappropriations by its former principals from client accounts for which TBA's former principals acted as trustee and over which TBA had custody.  TBA also failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 206(4)-2 under the Advisers Act by neglecting to obtain surprise examinations for several years for certain client accounts for which it had custody.  The SEC's order also finds that TBA filed numerous Forms ADV containing false information.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, TBA consented to entry of a cease-and-desist order, a censure, and to pay disgorgement, interest, and a penalty of over $1.7 million.  TBA also agreed to file a Form ADV/W withdrawing its registration with the Commission at the completion of its wind-down., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Katherine Bromberg, Jon Daniels, Neil Hendelman, Dugan Bliss, and Valerie A. Szczepanik of the New York Regional Office.  The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.  The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Bliss, Ms. Bromberg, and Mr. Daniels.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by investment adviser examiners in the New York Regional Office.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office., \n",

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that, on December 19, 2017, Judge Alison J. Nathan of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued an order finding Anvil Partners, Inc., a Buffalo, New York investment adviser registered with the SEC, and its majority owner, president, and chief investment officer, Jeremy Beck, to be in civil contempt of court for failing to comply with the court's prior order enforcing an SEC investigative subpoena directed to Anvil., \n",
       ", The SEC is investigating, among other things, whether Anvil materially overstated its assets under management in its public filings.  On June 6, 2017, the SEC issued an investigative subpoena to Anvil requiring that it produce certain documents.  However, Anvil failed to produce any documents or otherwise respond to the subpoena., \n",
       ", The SEC filed this subpoena enforcement action on August 21, 2017, and on September 21, 2017, the court entered an order requiring Anvil to comply with the SEC subpoena. Anvil failed to comply with the court's order, and, after holding a hearing on December 19, 2017, the court held Anvil and Beck in civil contempt. The contempt order requires Anvil and Beck to reimburse the SEC the costs of serving them with court papers in this proceeding, imposes a $250 daily fine against both Anvil and Beck until Anvil complies with the subpoena enforcement order, and orders Beck's arrest and appearance at a further January 10, 2018 hearing., \n",
       ", The SEC is continuing its fact-finding investigation and to date has not concluded that anyone has violated the securities laws., \n",

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges and an asset freeze against a group of unregistered funds and their owner who allegedly bilked thousands of retail investors, many of them seniors, in a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme., \n",
       ", SEC investigators filed this action to prevent further dissipation of investor assets after obtaining court orders in September and November in subpoena enforcement actions that forced the unregistered companies to open their books., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, unsealed today in federal court in Miami, Florida, Robert H. Shapiro and a group of unregistered investment companies called the Woodbridge Group of Companies LLC, listed below, formerly headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, defrauded more than 8,400 investors in unregistered Woodbridge funds. , \n",
       ", According to the SEC complaint, Woodbridge advertised its primary business as issuing loans to supposed third-party commercial property owners paying Woodbridge 11-15% annual interest for \"hard money,\" short-term financing.  In return, Woodbridge allegedly promised to pay investors 5-10 percent interest annually.  Woodbridge and Shapiro allegedly sought to avoid investors cashing out at the end of their terms and boasted in marketing materials that \"clients keep coming back to [Woodbridge] because time and experience have proven results.  Over 90% national renewal rate!\" While Woodbridge claimed it made high-interest loans to third parties, the SEC's complaint alleges that the vast majority of the borrowers were Shapiro-owned companies that had no income and never repaid the loans., \n",
       ", The SEC complaint alleges that Shapiro and Woodbridge used investors' money to pay other investors, and paid $64.5 million in commissions to sales agents who pitched the investments as \"low risk\" and \"conservative.\"  Shapiro, of Sherman Oaks, California, is alleged to have diverted at least $21 million for his own benefit, including to charter planes, pay country club fees, and buy luxury vehicles and jewelry.  According to the complaint, the scheme collapsed in typical Ponzi fashion in early December as Woodbridge stopped paying investors and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection., \n",
       ", The Honorable Judge Marcia G. Cooke granted the SEC's request for a temporary asset freeze against Shapiro and a group of his unregistered investment companies, and ordered them to provide an accounting of all money received from investors., \n",

Peters allegedly spent at least $4.4 million on such personal endeavors as remodeling a large farm in North Carolina, purchasing fine art for his home, and constructing a vacation home in Costa Rica.  Peters also spent at least $4.9 million to make Ponzi payments to earlier investors., \n",
       ", In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against Peters, including a charge that alleges that Peters attempted to withhold and conceal records from the SEC, fabricated records, and provided false testimony in the SEC's investigation of Peters' scheme., \n",

The court ordered Matrix and Mitsakos to pay disgorgement of $861,163.62, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $57,474.30, which is deemed satisfied by the $861,163.62 in restitution and $861,163.62 in forfeiture ordered against Mitsakos in a parallel criminal action.  The court also imposed an officer and director bar against Mitsakos and ordered Holt-Nguyen to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  In separate administrative proceedings, instituted December 19, 2017, Mitsakos agreed to be barred from the securities industry and from participating in penny stock offerings, Matrix agreed to be censured.

       ", SEC Charges Attorney and Accountant with Aiding and Abetting Adviser's $9 Million Theft from Charity Client, Adviser Settles Related Fraud Claims, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today charged New York-based investment advisor Train Babcock Advisors LLC (\"TBA\"), a New Jersey-based attorney, and a New York-based accountant, in connection with a fraudulent scheme led by TBA's former principal, John Rogicki, who stole more than $9 million from his advisory client, a charitable foundation established by an elderly widow to donate her estate to health and education causes., \n",
       ", TBA, which is in the process of winding down its operations, has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by paying more than $1.7 million in disgorgement, interest, and penalties for these and other violations.  TBA has also agreed to be censured and to withdraw its registration with the SEC as an investment advisor., \n",
       ", Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan against one of the foundation's trustees, attorney Robert Gaughran, and its accountant, Kevin Clune, alleging that they aided and abetted the fraud perpetrated by TBA and Rogicki, the foundation's investment adviser, President, and a trustee., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's filings, between 2004 and 2016, Rogicki took advantage of his roles as investment adviser and trustee to the foundation by liquidating securities positions in the foundation's advisory account with TBA and misappropriating a total of more than $9 million from the foundation for his own personal benefit.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Gaughran and Clune aided and abetted TBA's and Rogicki's fraudulent scheme.  While serving as a trustee of the foundation, Gaughran allegedly accepted outsized fees and ignored glaring signs of Rogicki's theft that were apparent from the foundation's brokerage statements and other documents that he regularly reviewed.  Gaughran also drafted the trust and estate papers that put Rogicki in charge of the charitable foundation and knew the size of the estate that should have flowed to the charitable foundation, but for Rogicki's misappropriation of $9 million of its assets.  According to the SEC's complaint, Clune, an accountant who performed tax work for both the estate that created the charitable foundation and the charitable foundation itself, ignored multiple and repeated red flags revealing Rogicki's and TBA's fraudulent scheme.  In addition, both Gaughran and Clune were actively involved in concealing the theft by providing false information to an outside audit firm during a surprise examination of the charitable foundation that was conducted in 2014., \n",
       ", On October 19, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court against Rogicki.  In a parallel criminal action, Rogicki pleaded guilty to criminal charges brought against him by the Manhattan District Attorney on October 19, 2017.  On December 14, 2017, Rogicki was sentenced to serve 30 to 90 months in prison and ordered to pay $6,728,391.77 to the foundation, of which he forfeited $2.5 million, in connection with his criminal plea.  The SEC also previously instituted administrative proceedings against former TBA CEO Brian J. Keenan on September 26, 2017, in connection with his misappropriation of assets from a separate client account.  The administrative proceedings against Keenan were settled on October 23, 2017., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Gaughran and Clune with aiding and abetting TBA's and Rogicki's violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and penalties against Gaughran and Clune., \n",
       ", The SEC's order instituting settled administrative proceedings against TBA finds that the adviser failed to detect and prevent two separate misappropriations by its former principals from client accounts for which TBA's former principals acted as trustee and over which TBA had custody.  TBA also failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 206(4)-2 under the Advisers Act by neglecting to obtain surprise examinations for several years for certain client accounts for which it had custody.  The SEC's order also finds that TBA filed numerous Forms ADV containing false information.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, TBA consented to entry of a cease-and-desist order, a censure, and to pay disgorgement, interest, and a penalty of over $1.7 million.  TBA also agreed to file a Form ADV/W withdrawing its registration with the Commission at the completion of its wind-down., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Katherine Bromberg, Jon Daniels, Neil Hendelman, Dugan Bliss, and Valerie A. Szczepanik of the New York Regional Office.  The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.  The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Bliss, Ms. Bromberg, and Mr. Daniels.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by investment adviser examiners in the New York Regional Office.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Manhattan District Attorney's Office., \n",

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that, on December 19, 2017, Judge Alison J. Nathan of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued an order finding Anvil Partners, Inc., a Buffalo, New York investment adviser registered with the SEC, and its majority owner, president, and chief investment officer, Jeremy Beck, to be in civil contempt of court for failing to comply with the court's prior order enforcing an SEC investigative subpoena directed to Anvil., \n",
       ", The SEC is investigating, among other things, whether Anvil materially overstated its assets under management in its public filings.  On June 6, 2017, the SEC issued an investigative subpoena to Anvil requiring that it produce certain documents.  However, Anvil failed to produce any documents or otherwise respond to the subpoena., \n",
       ", The SEC filed this subpoena enforcement action on August 21, 2017, and on September 21, 2017, the court entered an order requiring Anvil to comply with the SEC subpoena. Anvil failed to comply with the court's order, and, after holding a hearing on December 19, 2017, the court held Anvil and Beck in civil contempt. The contempt order requires Anvil and Beck to reimburse the SEC the costs of serving them with court papers in this proceeding, imposes a $250 daily fine against both Anvil and Beck until Anvil complies with the subpoena enforcement order, and orders Beck's arrest and appearance at a further January 10, 2018 hearing., \n",
       ", The SEC is continuing its fact-finding investigation and to date has not concluded that anyone has violated the securities laws., \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges and an asset freeze against a group of unregistered funds and their owner who allegedly bilked thousands of retail investors, many of them seniors, in a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme., \n",
       ", SEC investigators filed this action to prevent further dissipation of investor assets after obtaining court orders in September and November in subpoena enforcement actions that forced the unregistered companies to open their books., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, unsealed today in federal court in Miami, Florida, Robert H. Shapiro and a group of unregistered investment companies called the Woodbridge Group of Companies LLC, listed below, formerly headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, defrauded more than 8,400 investors in unregistered Woodbridge funds. , \n",
       ", According to the SEC complaint, Woodbridge advertised its primary business as issuing loans to supposed third-party commercial property owners paying Woodbridge 11-15% annual interest for \"hard money,\" short-term financing.  In return, Woodbridge allegedly promised to pay investors 5-10 percent interest annually.  Woodbridge and Shapiro allegedly sought to avoid investors cashing out at the end of their terms and boasted in marketing materials that \"clients keep coming back to [Woodbridge] because time and experience have proven results.  Over 90% national renewal rate!\" While Woodbridge claimed it made high-interest loans to third parties, the SEC's complaint alleges that the vast majority of the borrowers were Shapiro-owned companies that had no income and never repaid the loans., \n",
       ", The SEC complaint alleges that Shapiro and Woodbridge used investors' money to pay other investors, and paid $64.5 million in commissions to sales agents who pitched the investments as \"low risk\" and \"conservative.\"  Shapiro, of Sherman Oaks, California, is alleged to have diverted at least $21 million for his own benefit, including to charter planes, pay country club fees, and buy luxury vehicles and jewelry.  According to the complaint, the scheme collapsed in typical Ponzi fashion in early December as Woodbridge stopped paying investors and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection., \n",
       ", The Honorable Judge Marcia G. Cooke granted the SEC's request for a temporary asset freeze against Shapiro and a group of his unregistered investment companies, and ordered them to provide an accounting of all money received from investors., \n",

       ", The SEC alleges that Stephen C. Peters, through his investment adviser firm VisionQuest Wealth Management, sold promissory notes issued by another one of his companies, VisionQuest Capital, to clients and other prospective investors while making false statements, including that proceeds would be invested into revenue-producing businesses with neither Peters nor his businesses receiving compensation.  Peters allegedly claimed that the VisionQuest Capital notes presented little or no risk of loss and were \"guaranteed.\", \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, investor funds were not used as Peters claimed.  Peters allegedly spent at least $4.4 million on such personal endeavors as remodeling a large farm in North Carolina, purchasing fine art for his home, and constructing a vacation home in Costa Rica.  Peters also spent at least $4.9 million to make Ponzi payments to earlier investors., \n",

According to the SEC's complaint, Mitsakos and Matrix then stole money from the first client who invested with them based on their misrepresentations., \n",
       ", On December 4, 2017, the Honorable Paul Oetken of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, entered final judgments permanently enjoining Matrix, Mitsakos and Holt-Nguyen from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  The court ordered Matrix and Mitsakos to pay disgorgement of $861,163.62, plus prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $57,474.30, which is deemed satisfied by the $861,163.62 in restitution and $861,163.62 in forfeiture ordered against Mitsakos in a parallel criminal action.
