       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The  Honorable Janet C. Hall, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for  the District of Connecticut, has entered final consent judgments against defendants  David A. Bryson (“Bryson”), Bart C. Gutekunst (“Gutekunst”) and Richard Pereira  (“Pereira”) in the Commission’s action alleging that they engaged in fraud  while running hedge funds affiliated with New Stream Capital, LLC (“New  Stream”), formerly an unregistered investment adviser based in Ridgefield,  Connecticut., \n",
       ", The Commission’s  complaint alleges that the defendants, through New Stream and affiliated  entities, ran a  $750-plus million hedge fund complex focused on illiquid investments in  asset-based lending. Bryson and  Gutekunst were owners and senior managers of New Stream, and Pereira was New  Stream’s chief financial officer. The complaint  alleges that beginning in March 2008, Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira engaged in  a fraudulent scheme to make changes to the New Stream funds’ capital structure  without disclosing those changes to new investors in the funds. As alleged in the complaint, the undisclosed changes  to the capital structure subordinated the position of, among others, new fund  investors but were advantageous to other existing fund investors, including the  funds’ largest investor, which had threatened to redeem its investment. The complaint further alleges that following  the New Stream funds’ collapse in the wake of the financial crisis, the  investors’ whose position in the funds’ capital structure had been secretly  subordinated were left with significantly lower recoveries than the funds’  other investors., \n",
       ", The final  judgments, to which Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira consented, permanently enjoin  Bryson and Gutekunst from violating 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,  Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section  206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and Rule  206(4)-8 thereunder. Bryson and  Gutekunst were also enjoined from from violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of  the Advisers Act. The judgments also  require Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira to pay disgorgement and prejudgment  interest in the amounts of $6,347,252.55, $6,258,445.49 and $454,471.50,  respectively, and provide that the defendants’ liability for such amounts is deemed  satisfied by the $57 million restitution order entered jointly and severally  against them by the same court in the parallel criminal action brought by the  United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Connecticut (“USAO”). The judgments forgo the imposition of civil  monetary penalties in view of the prison sentences imposed on the defendants  pursuant to their guilty pleas in the parallel criminal action., \n",
       ", In  addition, the Commission issued administrative orders, pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act, barring  Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira from association with any broker, dealer,  investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent, and  suspending Pereira, a CPA, from appearing or practicing before the Commission  pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice. Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira also consented  to the issuance of the Commission orders, which were based on the permanent  injunctions entered against them in the federal court action and their guilty  pleas in the parallel criminal proceedings., \n",
       ", A final  consent judgment was previously entered against defendant, Tara Bryson, who was  the director of marketing and client relations at New Stream during the time of  the fraud alleged in the complaint, as well a Commission order, on consent,  barring her from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser,  municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent., \n",
       ", With  the Commission’s consent, the court dismissed the claims against defendants New  Stream and New Stream Capital (Cayman), Ltd., formerly an affiliated off-shore  advisory entity, both of which are now defunct and whose affiliated funds are  the subject of bankruptcy proceedings in which assets are being liquidated for  distribution to fund investors and other fund creditors pursuant to court  orders issued in the bankruptcy proceedings., \n",

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on December 23, 2015, the Honorable Katharine S. Hayden of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against defendant Michael J. Ling. The final judgment orders that Ling pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties in the amount of $554,005.98, and imposes on Ling a permanent injunction against future violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., \n",
       ", In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Ling, a day-trader, engaged in a manipulative trading scheme by repeatedly marking-the-close and entering into matched trades in shares of Cyberdefender Corp., a now-defunct computer software company, in order to maintain the price of the microcap company at or above $4.00 per share over the period September 2009 through June 2010. Maintaining a closing bid price at $4.00 per share or higher for 90 consecutive trading days prior to application was a prerequisite for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market., \n",
       ", Ling consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, the final judgment orders that Ling pay $454,005.98 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon and a $100,000 civil penalty., \n",

Nasatir and President Andrew L. Madenberg, both Illinois residents, with orchestrating a $5 million offering fraud involving nearly 100 investors located in 12 states that lasted over two years., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Illinois:, \n",
       ", \n",
       ", In April 2012, Southern Cross began to seek investors through offering documents that both Nasatir and Madenberg helped prepare.,  , \n",
       ", The offering documents falsely stated that Nasatir and Madenberg had placed between $26 million and $310 million of assets into the company, including nickel wire inventory and coal mining assets.,  , \n",
       ", The offering documents also referred to substantial coal reserves for which Southern Cross did not have rights or ownership interests.,  , \n",
       ", The offering documents also falsely represented that Nasatir and Madenberg had invested millions of dollars of their own money and assets into the company and owned a majority of the company's outstanding shares when they never owned more than a minority of Southern Cross' shares.,  , \n",
       ", Southern Cross also falsely informed investors that the company's shares were trading on the London Stock Exchange., \n",
       ", \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges Southern Cross, Nasatir, and Madenberg with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each of the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Southern Cross, Nasatir, and Madenberg each have consented to judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties in amounts to be determined by the Court at a later date., \n",
       ", In a separate related action, the Commission instituted a settled administrative proceeding against two Southern Cross promoters, Willard R. St. Germain and Allen M. Perres, both Illinois residents, for acting as unregistered brokers in selling unregistered securities to investors in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act., \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The  Honorable Janet C. Hall, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for  the District of Connecticut, has entered final consent judgments against defendants  David A. Bryson (“Bryson”), Bart C. Gutekunst (“Gutekunst”) and Richard Pereira  (“Pereira”) in the Commission’s action alleging that they engaged in fraud  while running hedge funds affiliated with New Stream Capital, LLC (“New  Stream”), formerly an unregistered investment adviser based in Ridgefield,  Connecticut., \n",
       ", The Commission’s  complaint alleges that the defendants, through New Stream and affiliated  entities, ran a  $750-plus million hedge fund complex focused on illiquid investments in  asset-based lending. Bryson and  Gutekunst were owners and senior managers of New Stream, and Pereira was New  Stream’s chief financial officer. The complaint  alleges that beginning in March 2008, Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira engaged in  a fraudulent scheme to make changes to the New Stream funds’ capital structure  without disclosing those changes to new investors in the funds. As alleged in the complaint, the undisclosed changes  to the capital structure subordinated the position of, among others, new fund  investors but were advantageous to other existing fund investors, including the  funds’ largest investor, which had threatened to redeem its investment. The complaint further alleges that following  the New Stream funds’ collapse in the wake of the financial crisis, the  investors’ whose position in the funds’ capital structure had been secretly  subordinated were left with significantly lower recoveries than the funds’  other investors., \n",
       ", The final  judgments, to which Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira consented, permanently enjoin  Bryson and Gutekunst from violating 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,  Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section  206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and Rule  206(4)-8 thereunder. Bryson and  Gutekunst were also enjoined from from violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of  the Advisers Act. The judgments also  require Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira to pay disgorgement and prejudgment  interest in the amounts of $6,347,252.55, $6,258,445.49 and $454,471.50,  respectively, and provide that the defendants’ liability for such amounts is deemed  satisfied by the $57 million restitution order entered jointly and severally  against them by the same court in the parallel criminal action brought by the  United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Connecticut (“USAO”). The judgments forgo the imposition of civil  monetary penalties in view of the prison sentences imposed on the defendants  pursuant to their guilty pleas in the parallel criminal action., \n",
       ", In  addition, the Commission issued administrative orders, pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act, barring  Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira from association with any broker, dealer,  investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent, and  suspending Pereira, a CPA, from appearing or practicing before the Commission  pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice. Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira also consented  to the issuance of the Commission orders, which were based on the permanent  injunctions entered against them in the federal court action and their guilty  pleas in the parallel criminal proceedings., \n",
       ", A final  consent judgment was previously entered against defendant, Tara Bryson, who was  the director of marketing and client relations at New Stream during the time of  the fraud alleged in the complaint, as well a Commission order, on consent,  barring her from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser,  municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent., \n",
       ", With  the Commission’s consent, the court dismissed the claims against defendants New  Stream and New Stream Capital (Cayman), Ltd., formerly an affiliated off-shore  advisory entity, both of which are now defunct and whose affiliated funds are  the subject of bankruptcy proceedings in which assets are being liquidated for  distribution to fund investors and other fund creditors pursuant to court  orders issued in the bankruptcy proceedings., \n",

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on December 23, 2015, the Honorable Katharine S. Hayden of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against defendant Michael J. Ling. The final judgment orders that Ling pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties in the amount of $554,005.98, and imposes on Ling a permanent injunction against future violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., \n",
       ", In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Ling, a day-trader, engaged in a manipulative trading scheme by repeatedly marking-the-close and entering into matched trades in shares of Cyberdefender Corp., a now-defunct computer software company, in order to maintain the price of the microcap company at or above $4.00 per share over the period September 2009 through June 2010. Maintaining a closing bid price at $4.00 per share or higher for 90 consecutive trading days prior to application was a prerequisite for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market., \n",
       ", Ling consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, the final judgment orders that Ling pay $454,005.98 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon and a $100,000 civil penalty., \n",

       ", SEC Charges Illinois Energy Trading Company and Its Senior Officers with Fraud, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", On December 22, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Vernon Hills, Illinois-based Southern Cross Resources Group, Inc., an asset-based trading company, and its CEO Michael A. Nasatir and President Andrew L. Madenberg, both Illinois residents, with orchestrating a $5 million offering fraud involving nearly 100 investors located in 12 states that lasted over two years., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Illinois:, \n",
       ", \n",
       ", In April 2012, Southern Cross began to seek investors through offering documents that both Nasatir and Madenberg helped prepare.,  , \n",
       ", The offering documents falsely stated that Nasatir and Madenberg had placed between $26 million and $310 million of assets into the company, including nickel wire inventory and coal mining assets.,  , \n",
       ", The offering documents also referred to substantial coal reserves for which Southern Cross did not have rights or ownership interests.,  , \n",
       ", The offering documents also falsely represented that Nasatir and Madenberg had invested millions of dollars of their own money and assets into the company and owned a majority of the company's outstanding shares when they never owned more than a minority of Southern Cross' shares.,  , \n",
       ", Southern Cross also falsely informed investors that the company's shares were trading on the London Stock Exchange., \n",
       ", \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges Southern Cross, Nasatir, and Madenberg with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each of the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Southern Cross, Nasatir, and Madenberg each have consented to judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties in amounts to be determined by the Court at a later date., \n",
       ", In a separate related action, the Commission instituted a settled administrative proceeding against two Southern Cross promoters, Willard R. St. Germain and Allen M. Perres, both Illinois residents, for acting as unregistered brokers in selling unregistered securities to investors in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Emily A. Rothblatt and Scott J. Hlavacek, and supervised by Anne C. McKinley in the Chicago Regional Office.  The SEC's litigation will be led by Robert M. Moye., \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The  Honorable Janet C. Hall, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for  the District of Connecticut, has entered final consent judgments against defendants  David A. Bryson (“Bryson”), Bart C. Gutekunst (“Gutekunst”) and Richard Pereira  (“Pereira”) in the Commission’s action alleging that they engaged in fraud  while running hedge funds affiliated with New Stream Capital, LLC (“New  Stream”), formerly an unregistered investment adviser based in Ridgefield,  Connecticut., \n",
       ", The Commission’s  complaint alleges that the defendants, through New Stream and affiliated  entities, ran a  $750-plus million hedge fund complex focused on illiquid investments in  asset-based lending. Bryson and  Gutekunst were owners and senior managers of New Stream, and Pereira was New  Stream’s chief financial officer. The complaint  alleges that beginning in March 2008, Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira engaged in  a fraudulent scheme to make changes to the New Stream funds’ capital structure  without disclosing those changes to new investors in the funds. As alleged in the complaint, the undisclosed changes  to the capital structure subordinated the position of, among others, new fund  investors but were advantageous to other existing fund investors, including the  funds’ largest investor, which had threatened to redeem its investment. The complaint further alleges that following  the New Stream funds’ collapse in the wake of the financial crisis, the  investors’ whose position in the funds’ capital structure had been secretly  subordinated were left with significantly lower recoveries than the funds’  other investors., \n",
       ", The final  judgments, to which Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira consented, permanently enjoin  Bryson and Gutekunst from violating 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,  Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section  206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and Rule  206(4)-8 thereunder. Bryson and  Gutekunst were also enjoined from from violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of  the Advisers Act. The judgments also  require Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira to pay disgorgement and prejudgment  interest in the amounts of $6,347,252.55, $6,258,445.49 and $454,471.50,  respectively, and provide that the defendants’ liability for such amounts is deemed  satisfied by the $57 million restitution order entered jointly and severally  against them by the same court in the parallel criminal action brought by the  United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Connecticut (“USAO”). The judgments forgo the imposition of civil  monetary penalties in view of the prison sentences imposed on the defendants  pursuant to their guilty pleas in the parallel criminal action., \n",
       ", In  addition, the Commission issued administrative orders, pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act, barring  Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira from association with any broker, dealer,  investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent, and  suspending Pereira, a CPA, from appearing or practicing before the Commission  pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice. Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira also consented  to the issuance of the Commission orders, which were based on the permanent  injunctions entered against them in the federal court action and their guilty  pleas in the parallel criminal proceedings., \n",
       ", A final  consent judgment was previously entered against defendant, Tara Bryson, who was  the director of marketing and client relations at New Stream during the time of  the fraud alleged in the complaint, as well a Commission order, on consent,  barring her from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser,  municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent., \n",
       ", With  the Commission’s consent, the court dismissed the claims against defendants New  Stream and New Stream Capital (Cayman), Ltd., formerly an affiliated off-shore  advisory entity, both of which are now defunct and whose affiliated funds are  the subject of bankruptcy proceedings in which assets are being liquidated for  distribution to fund investors and other fund creditors pursuant to court  orders issued in the bankruptcy proceedings., \n",

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on December 23, 2015, the Honorable Katharine S. Hayden of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against defendant Michael J. Ling. The final judgment orders that Ling pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties in the amount of $554,005.98, and imposes on Ling a permanent injunction against future violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., \n",
       ", In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Ling, a day-trader, engaged in a manipulative trading scheme by repeatedly marking-the-close and entering into matched trades in shares of Cyberdefender Corp., a now-defunct computer software company, in order to maintain the price of the microcap company at or above $4.00 per share over the period September 2009 through June 2010. Maintaining a closing bid price at $4.00 per share or higher for 90 consecutive trading days prior to application was a prerequisite for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market., \n",
       ", Ling consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In addition, the final judgment orders that Ling pay $454,005.98 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon and a $100,000 civil penalty., \n",

Nasatir and President Andrew L. Madenberg, both Illinois residents, with orchestrating a $5 million offering fraud involving nearly 100 investors located in 12 states that lasted over two years., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Illinois:, \n",
       ", \n",
       ", In April 2012, Southern Cross began to seek investors through offering documents that both Nasatir and Madenberg helped prepare.,  , \n",
       ", The offering documents falsely stated that Nasatir and Madenberg had placed between $26 million and $310 million of assets into the company, including nickel wire inventory and coal mining assets.,  , \n",
       ", The offering documents also referred to substantial coal reserves for which Southern Cross did not have rights or ownership interests.,  , \n",
       ", The offering documents also falsely represented that Nasatir and Madenberg had invested millions of dollars of their own money and assets into the company and owned a majority of the company's outstanding shares when they never owned more than a minority of Southern Cross' shares.,  , \n",
       ", Southern Cross also falsely informed investors that the company's shares were trading on the London Stock Exchange., \n",
       ", \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges Southern Cross, Nasatir, and Madenberg with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each of the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Southern Cross, Nasatir, and Madenberg each have consented to judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties in amounts to be determined by the Court at a later date., \n",
       ", In a separate related action, the Commission instituted a settled administrative proceeding against two Southern Cross promoters, Willard R. St. Germain and Allen M. Perres, both Illinois residents, for acting as unregistered brokers in selling unregistered securities to investors in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act., \n",

       ", The  Honorable Janet C. Hall, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for  the District of Connecticut, has entered final consent judgments against defendants  David A. Bryson (“Bryson”), Bart C. Gutekunst (“Gutekunst”) and Richard Pereira  (“Pereira”) in the Commission’s action alleging that they engaged in fraud  while running hedge funds affiliated with New Stream Capital, LLC (“New  Stream”), formerly an unregistered investment adviser based in Ridgefield,  Connecticut., \n",
       ", The Commission’s  complaint alleges that the defendants, through New Stream and affiliated  entities, ran a  $750-plus million hedge fund complex focused on illiquid investments in  asset-based lending. Bryson and  Gutekunst were owners and senior managers of New Stream, and Pereira was New  Stream’s chief financial officer. The complaint  alleges that beginning in March 2008, Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira engaged in  a fraudulent scheme to make changes to the New Stream funds’ capital structure  without disclosing those changes to new investors in the funds. As alleged in the complaint, the undisclosed changes  to the capital structure subordinated the position of, among others, new fund  investors but were advantageous to other existing fund investors, including the  funds’ largest investor, which had threatened to redeem its investment. The complaint further alleges that following  the New Stream funds’ collapse in the wake of the financial crisis, the  investors’ whose position in the funds’ capital structure had been secretly  subordinated were left with significantly lower recoveries than the funds’  other investors., \n",
       ", The final  judgments, to which Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira consented, permanently enjoin  Bryson and Gutekunst from violating 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,  Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section  206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and Rule  206(4)-8 thereunder. Bryson and  Gutekunst were also enjoined from from violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of  the Advisers Act. The judgments also  require Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira to pay disgorgement and prejudgment  interest in the amounts of $6,347,252.55, $6,258,445.49 and $454,471.50,  respectively, and provide that the defendants’ liability for such amounts is deemed  satisfied by the $57 million restitution order entered jointly and severally  against them by the same court in the parallel criminal action brought by the  United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Connecticut (“USAO”). The judgments forgo the imposition of civil  monetary penalties in view of the prison sentences imposed on the defendants  pursuant to their guilty pleas in the parallel criminal action., \n",
       ", In  addition, the Commission issued administrative orders, pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act, barring  Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira from association with any broker, dealer,  investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent, and  suspending Pereira, a CPA, from appearing or practicing before the Commission  pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice. Bryson, Gutekunst and Pereira also consented  to the issuance of the Commission orders, which were based on the permanent  injunctions entered against them in the federal court action and their guilty  pleas in the parallel criminal proceedings., \n",
       ", A final  consent judgment was previously entered against defendant, Tara Bryson, who was  the director of marketing and client relations at New Stream during the time of  the fraud alleged in the complaint, as well a Commission order, on consent,  barring her from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser,  municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent., \n",
       ", With  the Commission’s consent, the court dismissed the claims against defendants New  Stream and New Stream Capital (Cayman), Ltd., formerly an affiliated off-shore  advisory entity, both of which are now defunct and whose affiliated funds are  the subject of bankruptcy proceedings in which assets are being liquidated for  distribution to fund investors and other fund creditors pursuant to court  orders issued in the bankruptcy proceedings., \n",

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that on December 23, 2015, the Honorable Katharine S. Hayden of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against defendant Michael J. Ling. The final judgment orders that Ling pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties in the amount of $554,005.98, and imposes on Ling a permanent injunction against future violations of certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws., \n",
       ", In its Complaint, the Commission alleged that Ling, a day-trader, engaged in a manipulative trading scheme by repeatedly marking-the-close and entering into matched trades in shares of Cyberdefender Corp., a now-defunct computer software company, in order to maintain the price of the microcap company at or above $4.00 per share over the period September 2009 through June 2010. Maintaining a closing bid price at $4.00 per share or higher for 90 consecutive trading days prior to application was a prerequisite for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market., \n",
       ", Ling consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

       ", SEC Charges Illinois Energy Trading Company and Its Senior Officers with Fraud, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", On December 22, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Vernon Hills, Illinois-based Southern Cross Resources Group, Inc., an asset-based trading company, and its CEO Michael A. Nasatir and President Andrew L. Madenberg, both Illinois residents, with orchestrating a $5 million offering fraud involving nearly 100 investors located in 12 states that lasted over two years., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Illinois:, \n",
       ", \n",
       ", In April 2012, Southern Cross began to seek investors through offering documents that both Nasatir and Madenberg helped prepare.,  , \n",
       ", The offering documents falsely stated that Nasatir and Madenberg had placed between $26 million and $310 million of assets into the company, including nickel wire inventory and coal mining assets.,  , \n",
       ", The offering documents also referred to substantial coal reserves for which Southern Cross did not have rights or ownership interests.,  , \n",
       ", The offering documents also falsely represented that Nasatir and Madenberg had invested millions of dollars of their own money and assets into the company and owned a majority of the company's outstanding shares when they never owned more than a minority of Southern Cross' shares.,  , \n",
       ", Southern Cross also falsely informed investors that the company's shares were trading on the London Stock Exchange., \n",
       ", \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges Southern Cross, Nasatir, and Madenberg with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each of the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Southern Cross, Nasatir, and Madenberg each have consented to judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties in amounts to be determined by the Court at a later date., \n",
       ", In a separate related action, the Commission instituted a settled administrative proceeding against two Southern Cross promoters, Willard R. St. Germain and Allen M. Perres, both Illinois residents, for acting as unregistered brokers in selling unregistered securities to investors in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act and Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Emily A. Rothblatt and Scott J. Hlavacek, and supervised by Anne C. McKinley in the Chicago Regional Office.  The SEC's litigation will be led by Robert M. Moye., \n",
