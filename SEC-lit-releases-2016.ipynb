       ", Businessman Settles Charges of Fraudulent EB-5 Offering, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Florida-based businessman has agreed to settle charges that he misused investor funds intended to create U.S. jobs through the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that Jason Adam Ogden, the CEO of a pair of smoothie and frozen yogurt franchises called Juiceblendz and Yoblendz, formed AJN Investments LLC to conduct an investment offering in conjunction with the EB-5 program, which provides foreign investors a path to permanent residency when their investments create at least 10 jobs for American workers. Investors were allegedly told that their money would help build and operate Juiceblendz and Yoblendz stores in strip malls and create a sufficient amount of jobs for them to qualify for an EB-5 visa and ultimately a green card., \n",
       ", But according to the SEC's complaint, Ogden changed his business model midstream without updating the offering materials, focusing on developing kiosks in sports arenas and university campuses rather than following through with the construction of full-size stores. Not only did this result in smaller-than-promised returns for investors, but also jeopardized their EB-5 program status because kiosks don't stimulate the same job creation as full-size stores and construction projects., \n",
       ", The SEC further alleges that Ogden improperly siphoned more than $1 million in investor funds for his personal use, making undisclosed cash transfers to his bank account. Ogden allegedly used investor funds to repay a personal loan and pay for meals and entertainment., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Florida, charges Ogden and AJN Investments with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. They agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations. Ogden agreed to pay back the amount of investor funds he misused for his own personal benefit totaling $1,008,681, plus interest of $41,024 and a penalty of $160,000. The settlement is subject to court approval., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kimberly A. Cain, Jennifer R. Turner, Timothy L. Evans, and Ty S. Martinez and supervised by Jonathan P. Scott and David L. Peavler of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today the resolution of an enforcement action filed by the Commission on June 16, 2015 against a Massachusetts-based investment advisory firm, Interinvest Corporation, and its owner, Hans Peter Black.  The Court entered default judgments against Interinvest and Black after both failed to answer the SEC's complaint., \n",
       ", The default judgments ordered each defendant to pay, jointly and severally, $5.4 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, reflecting management fees and other payments collected from investor funds.  The Court also imposed $2 million in civil monetary penalites against Black and $1.5 million in penalties against Interinvest.  In assessing the penalty, the Court observed that the defendants' breach of fiduciary duties through the fraudulent scheme constituted \"recurrent and egregious conduct.\"  In addition, the Court's judgment enjoins Interinvest and Black from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The SEC previously had obtained a preliminary injunction against Interinvest and Black to freeze their assets and to prohibit them from continuing to exercise investment authority over client assets under management., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleged that Interinvest and Black funneled more than $17 million in client assets into four financially troubled Canadian penny stock companies in which Black had undisclosed business and financial interests.  According to the complaint, Interinvest clients lost as much as $12 million of their $17 million investment based on the trading in the penny stock companies, some of which were purportedly in the business of exploring for gold or other minerals.  Black served on the board of directors of these companies, which collectively paid approximately $1.9 million to an entity that he controlled.  The SEC alleged that Black's involvement with these companies and his receipt of payments from them created a conflict of interest that he and Interinvest failed to disclose to their advisory clients., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Vito, Peter Moores, John McCann, Chip Harper, and Celia Moore of the Boston Regional Office.

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a California-based attorney with defrauding investors seeking to participate in the EB-5 immigrant investor program, stealing their money to buy a yacht and prop up his other businesses., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that Emilio Francisco raised $72 million from investors in China solicited through his marketing firm PDC Capital to invest in EB-5 projects that included opening Caffe Primo restaurants, developing assisted living facilities, and renovating a production facility for environmentally friendly agriculture and cleaning products. Under the EB-5 program, foreign investors can apply to permanently live and work in the U.S. by investing money in certain projects that bring about American jobs., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, Francisco and PDC Capital diverted investor funds from one project to another and outright stole at least $9.6 million that was used to finance Francisco's own businesses and luxury lifestyle. Francisco was allegedly aware that doing so would violate federal regulations and jeopardize any visas for the foreign investors., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges Francisco, PDC Capital, and 20 other Francisco-controlled businesses with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The complaint also alleges that Francisco and PDC Capital aided and abetted the other defendants' violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b), and that Francisco is also liable under section 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as a control person of the entity defendants.

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three Chinese traders with fraudulently trading on hacked nonpublic market moving information stolen from two prominent New York-based law firms, racking up almost $3 million in illegal profits.  The SEC is also seeking an asset freeze that prevents the traders from cashing in on their illicit gains.  Today's action marks the first time the SEC has charged hacking into a law firm's computer network., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleges that Iat Hong, Bo Zheng, and Hung Chin executed a deceptive scheme to hack into the networks of two law firms and steal confidential information pertaining to firm clients that were considering mergers or acquisitions., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, the alleged hacking incidents involved installing malware on the law firms' networks, compromising accounts that enabled access to all email accounts at the firms, and copying and transmitting dozens of gigabytes of emails to remote internet locations.  Defendants Hong and Zheng in particular coveted the emails of attorneys involved in mergers and acquisitions, as they exchanged a list of partners who performed the work at one of the law firms prior to the hack at that firm., \n",
       ", In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, Hong, Zheng, and Chin used the stolen confidential information contained in emails to purchase shares in at least three public companies ahead of public announcements about entering into merger agreements.  The SEC alleges that they spent approximately $7.5 million in a one-month period buying shares in semiconductor company Altera Inc. in advance of a 2015 report that it was in talks to be acquired by Intel Corporation.  Within 12 hours of emails being extracted from one of the firms, Hong and Chin allegedly began purchasing shares of e-commerce company Borderfree so aggressively that they accounted for at least 25 percent of the company's trading volume on certain days in advance of the announcement of a 2015 deal.  Hong and Zheng also allegedly traded in advance of a 2014 merger announcement involving InterMune, a pharmaceutical company., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges Hong, Zheng, and Chin with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules.  The SEC seeks a final judgment ordering them to pay penalties and disgorge ill-gotten gains plus interest and permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws.  Hong's mother is named as a relief defendant in the SEC's complaint for the purpose of recovering ill-gotten gains in her accounts resulting from her son's illicit trading., \n",

       ", SEC Obtains Preliminary Injunction and Asset Freeze Against Investment Adviser for Defrauding Massachusetts Retirees, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has obtained a preliminary injunction and an asset freeze against investment adviser and broker representative Richard G. Cody, a former resident of Massachusetts and current resident of New Jersey., \n",
       ", The preliminary injunction restrains Cody and his company, Boston Investment Partners, LLC (BIP), from violating certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, orders that the defendants' assets be frozen until further notice, enjoins them from exercising any authority or control over client accounts, and orders a detailed accounting of Cody's and BIP's assets., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, filed on December 12, 2016 in federal court in Massachusetts, alleges that Cody defrauded at least three of his retired clients over a twelve-year period by concealing the fact that their retirement accounts had suffered extensive losses. The SEC alleges that the clients did not know that their accounts had lost substantial value and were being rapidly depleted. Cody allegedly concealed these losses by leading the clients to believe that their investments were maintaining steady value and that the clients were living off income from their investments. By 2014, two of the retirees' accounts allegedly had essentially run out of funds. Cody allegedly continued to hide that the retirees' money was gone by making wire transfers of monthly deposits to the retirees' bank accounts from other sources and sending the clients fabricated tax forms. The SEC alleges that these deceptive acts caused Cody's clients to believe that their retirement savings were secure when, in fact, they were not., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleges that Cody violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest and penalties as well as permanent injunctive relief., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Alicia M. Reed, John McCann, Amy Gwiazda, Richard Harper and Louis Randazzo of the SEC's Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Harper. The SEC's investigation is continuing., \n",
       ", The SEC acknowledges the assistance of FINRA in this matter., \n",

       ", Businessman Settles Charges of Fraudulent EB-5 Offering, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Florida-based businessman has agreed to settle charges that he misused investor funds intended to create U.S. jobs through the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that Jason Adam Ogden, the CEO of a pair of smoothie and frozen yogurt franchises called Juiceblendz and Yoblendz, formed AJN Investments LLC to conduct an investment offering in conjunction with the EB-5 program, which provides foreign investors a path to permanent residency when their investments create at least 10 jobs for American workers. Investors were allegedly told that their money would help build and operate Juiceblendz and Yoblendz stores in strip malls and create a sufficient amount of jobs for them to qualify for an EB-5 visa and ultimately a green card., \n",
       ", But according to the SEC's complaint, Ogden changed his business model midstream without updating the offering materials, focusing on developing kiosks in sports arenas and university campuses rather than following through with the construction of full-size stores. Not only did this result in smaller-than-promised returns for investors, but also jeopardized their EB-5 program status because kiosks don't stimulate the same job creation as full-size stores and construction projects., \n",
       ", The SEC further alleges that Ogden improperly siphoned more than $1 million in investor funds for his personal use, making undisclosed cash transfers to his bank account. Ogden allegedly used investor funds to repay a personal loan and pay for meals and entertainment., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Florida, charges Ogden and AJN Investments with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. They agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations. Ogden agreed to pay back the amount of investor funds he misused for his own personal benefit totaling $1,008,681, plus interest of $41,024 and a penalty of $160,000. The settlement is subject to court approval., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kimberly A. Cain, Jennifer R. Turner, Timothy L. Evans, and Ty S. Martinez and supervised by Jonathan P. Scott and David L. Peavler of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n",

       ", Federal Court Imposes $7.4 Million Judgment Against Massachusetts Investment Adviser Who Steered Money to Firms that Paid Him Consulting Fees, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today the resolution of an enforcement action filed by the Commission on June 16, 2015 against a Massachusetts-based investment advisory firm, Interinvest Corporation, and its owner, Hans Peter Black.  The Court entered default judgments against Interinvest and Black after both failed to answer the SEC's complaint., \n",
       ", The default judgments ordered each defendant to pay, jointly and severally, $5.4 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, reflecting management fees and other payments collected from investor funds.  The Court also imposed $2 million in civil monetary penalites against Black and $1.5 million in penalties against Interinvest.  In assessing the penalty, the Court observed that the defendants' breach of fiduciary duties through the fraudulent scheme constituted \"recurrent and egregious conduct.\"  In addition, the Court's judgment enjoins Interinvest and Black from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The SEC previously had obtained a preliminary injunction against Interinvest and Black to freeze their assets and to prohibit them from continuing to exercise investment authority over client assets under management., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleged that Interinvest and Black funneled more than $17 million in client assets into four financially troubled Canadian penny stock companies in which Black had undisclosed business and financial interests.  According to the complaint, Interinvest clients lost as much as $12 million of their $17 million investment based on the trading in the penny stock companies, some of which were purportedly in the business of exploring for gold or other minerals.  Black served on the board of directors of these companies, which collectively paid approximately $1.9 million to an entity that he controlled.  The SEC alleged that Black's involvement with these companies and his receipt of payments from them created a conflict of interest that he and Interinvest failed to disclose to their advisory clients., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Vito, Peter Moores, John McCann, Chip Harper, and Celia Moore of the Boston Regional Office.  The SEC's examination of Interinvest, which identified the violations described in the SEC's complaint, was conducted by Raymond Titus, Paul Prata, Daniel Wong, and Melissa Clough of the Boston Regional Office., \n",

       ", The SEC alleges that Emilio Francisco raised $72 million from investors in China solicited through his marketing firm PDC Capital to invest in EB-5 projects that included opening Caffe Primo restaurants, developing assisted living facilities, and renovating a production facility for environmentally friendly agriculture and cleaning products. Under the EB-5 program, foreign investors can apply to permanently live and work in the U.S. by investing money in certain projects that bring about American jobs., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, Francisco and PDC Capital diverted investor funds from one project to another and outright stole at least $9.6 million that was used to finance Francisco's own businesses and luxury lifestyle. Francisco was allegedly aware that doing so would violate federal regulations and jeopardize any visas for the foreign investors., \n",

The complaint also alleges that Francisco and PDC Capital aided and abetted the other defendants' violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b), and that Francisco is also liable under section 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as a control person of the entity defendants.

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three Chinese traders with fraudulently trading on hacked nonpublic market moving information stolen from two prominent New York-based law firms, racking up almost $3 million in illegal profits.  The SEC is also seeking an asset freeze that prevents the traders from cashing in on their illicit gains.  Today's action marks the first time the SEC has charged hacking into a law firm's computer network., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleges that Iat Hong, Bo Zheng, and Hung Chin executed a deceptive scheme to hack into the networks of two law firms and steal confidential information pertaining to firm clients that were considering mergers or acquisitions., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, the alleged hacking incidents involved installing malware on the law firms' networks, compromising accounts that enabled access to all email accounts at the firms, and copying and transmitting dozens of gigabytes of emails to remote internet locations.  Defendants Hong and Zheng in particular coveted the emails of attorneys involved in mergers and acquisitions, as they exchanged a list of partners who performed the work at one of the law firms prior to the hack at that firm., \n",
       ", In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, Hong, Zheng, and Chin used the stolen confidential information contained in emails to purchase shares in at least three public companies ahead of public announcements about entering into merger agreements.  The SEC alleges that they spent approximately $7.5 million in a one-month period buying shares in semiconductor company Altera Inc. in advance of a 2015 report that it was in talks to be acquired by Intel Corporation.  Within 12 hours of emails being extracted from one of the firms, Hong and Chin allegedly began purchasing shares of e-commerce company Borderfree so aggressively that they accounted for at least 25 percent of the company's trading volume on certain days in advance of the announcement of a 2015 deal.  Hong and Zheng also allegedly traded in advance of a 2014 merger announcement involving InterMune, a pharmaceutical company., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges Hong, Zheng, and Chin with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules.  The SEC seeks a final judgment ordering them to pay penalties and disgorge ill-gotten gains plus interest and permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws.  Hong's mother is named as a relief defendant in the SEC's complaint for the purpose of recovering ill-gotten gains in her accounts resulting from her son's illicit trading., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation is continuing, and is being conducted by Jennie B.

       ", SEC Obtains Preliminary Injunction and Asset Freeze Against Investment Adviser for Defrauding Massachusetts Retirees, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has obtained a preliminary injunction and an asset freeze against investment adviser and broker representative Richard G. Cody, a former resident of Massachusetts and current resident of New Jersey., \n",
       ", The preliminary injunction restrains Cody and his company, Boston Investment Partners, LLC (BIP), from violating certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, orders that the defendants' assets be frozen until further notice, enjoins them from exercising any authority or control over client accounts, and orders a detailed accounting of Cody's and BIP's assets., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, filed on December 12, 2016 in federal court in Massachusetts, alleges that Cody defrauded at least three of his retired clients over a twelve-year period by concealing the fact that their retirement accounts had suffered extensive losses. The SEC alleges that the clients did not know that their accounts had lost substantial value and were being rapidly depleted. Cody allegedly concealed these losses by leading the clients to believe that their investments were maintaining steady value and that the clients were living off income from their investments. By 2014, two of the retirees' accounts allegedly had essentially run out of funds. Cody allegedly continued to hide that the retirees' money was gone by making wire transfers of monthly deposits to the retirees' bank accounts from other sources and sending the clients fabricated tax forms. The SEC alleges that these deceptive acts caused Cody's clients to believe that their retirement savings were secure when, in fact, they were not., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleges that Cody violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest and penalties as well as permanent injunctive relief., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Alicia M. Reed, John McCann, Amy Gwiazda, Richard Harper and Louis Randazzo of the SEC's Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Harper. The SEC's investigation is continuing., \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Florida-based businessman has agreed to settle charges that he misused investor funds intended to create U.S. jobs through the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that Jason Adam Ogden, the CEO of a pair of smoothie and frozen yogurt franchises called Juiceblendz and Yoblendz, formed AJN Investments LLC to conduct an investment offering in conjunction with the EB-5 program, which provides foreign investors a path to permanent residency when their investments create at least 10 jobs for American workers. Investors were allegedly told that their money would help build and operate Juiceblendz and Yoblendz stores in strip malls and create a sufficient amount of jobs for them to qualify for an EB-5 visa and ultimately a green card., \n",
       ", But according to the SEC's complaint, Ogden changed his business model midstream without updating the offering materials, focusing on developing kiosks in sports arenas and university campuses rather than following through with the construction of full-size stores. Not only did this result in smaller-than-promised returns for investors, but also jeopardized their EB-5 program status because kiosks don't stimulate the same job creation as full-size stores and construction projects., \n",
       ", The SEC further alleges that Ogden improperly siphoned more than $1 million in investor funds for his personal use, making undisclosed cash transfers to his bank account. Ogden allegedly used investor funds to repay a personal loan and pay for meals and entertainment., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Florida, charges Ogden and AJN Investments with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. They agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations. Ogden agreed to pay back the amount of investor funds he misused for his own personal benefit totaling $1,008,681, plus interest of $41,024 and a penalty of $160,000. The settlement is subject to court approval., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kimberly A. Cain, Jennifer R. Turner, Timothy L. Evans, and Ty S. Martinez and supervised by Jonathan P. Scott and David L. Peavler of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today the resolution of an enforcement action filed by the Commission on June 16, 2015 against a Massachusetts-based investment advisory firm, Interinvest Corporation, and its owner, Hans Peter Black.  The Court entered default judgments against Interinvest and Black after both failed to answer the SEC's complaint., \n",
       ", The default judgments ordered each defendant to pay, jointly and severally, $5.4 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, reflecting management fees and other payments collected from investor funds.  The Court also imposed $2 million in civil monetary penalites against Black and $1.5 million in penalties against Interinvest.  In assessing the penalty, the Court observed that the defendants' breach of fiduciary duties through the fraudulent scheme constituted \"recurrent and egregious conduct.\"  In addition, the Court's judgment enjoins Interinvest and Black from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The SEC previously had obtained a preliminary injunction against Interinvest and Black to freeze their assets and to prohibit them from continuing to exercise investment authority over client assets under management., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleged that Interinvest and Black funneled more than $17 million in client assets into four financially troubled Canadian penny stock companies in which Black had undisclosed business and financial interests.  According to the complaint, Interinvest clients lost as much as $12 million of their $17 million investment based on the trading in the penny stock companies, some of which were purportedly in the business of exploring for gold or other minerals.  Black served on the board of directors of these companies, which collectively paid approximately $1.9 million to an entity that he controlled.  The SEC alleged that Black's involvement with these companies and his receipt of payments from them created a conflict of interest that he and Interinvest failed to disclose to their advisory clients., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Vito, Peter Moores, John McCann, Chip Harper, and Celia Moore of the Boston Regional Office.  The SEC's examination of Interinvest, which identified the violations described in the SEC's complaint, was conducted by Raymond Titus, Paul Prata, Daniel Wong, and Melissa Clough of the Boston Regional Office., \n",

       ", Securities and Exchange Commission v. Emilio Francisco, et al., , Civil Action No. 8:16-cv-02257-CJC-DFM (Central District of California, Complaint filed December 27, 2016), \n",
       ", SEC Charges Lawyer with Stealing Investor Money in Eb-5 Offerings, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a California-based attorney with defrauding investors seeking to participate in the EB-5 immigrant investor program, stealing their money to buy a yacht and prop up his other businesses., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that Emilio Francisco raised $72 million from investors in China solicited through his marketing firm PDC Capital to invest in EB-5 projects that included opening Caffe Primo restaurants, developing assisted living facilities, and renovating a production facility for environmentally friendly agriculture and cleaning products. Under the EB-5 program, foreign investors can apply to permanently live and work in the U.S. by investing money in certain projects that bring about American jobs., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, Francisco and PDC Capital diverted investor funds from one project to another and outright stole at least $9.6 million that was used to finance Francisco's own businesses and luxury lifestyle. Francisco was allegedly aware that doing so would violate federal regulations and jeopardize any visas for the foreign investors., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges Francisco, PDC Capital, and 20 other Francisco-controlled businesses with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The complaint also alleges that Francisco and PDC Capital aided and abetted the other defendants' violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b), and that Francisco is also liable under section 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as a control person of the entity defendants. The SEC is seeking an emergency asset freeze and a court-appointed receiver over Francisco's businesses involved in the schemes., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation has been conducted in the Los Angeles office by Adrienne D. Gurley, Jasmine Starr, and Christopher M. Conte, and the case has been supervised by Spencer Bendell, Alka N. Patel and John W. Berry. The SEC's litigation is being led by John B. Bulgozdy.

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three Chinese traders with fraudulently trading on hacked nonpublic market moving information stolen from two prominent New York-based law firms, racking up almost $3 million in illegal profits.  The SEC is also seeking an asset freeze that prevents the traders from cashing in on their illicit gains.  Today's action marks the first time the SEC has charged hacking into a law firm's computer network., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleges that Iat Hong, Bo Zheng, and Hung Chin executed a deceptive scheme to hack into the networks of two law firms and steal confidential information pertaining to firm clients that were considering mergers or acquisitions., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, the alleged hacking incidents involved installing malware on the law firms' networks, compromising accounts that enabled access to all email accounts at the firms, and copying and transmitting dozens of gigabytes of emails to remote internet locations.  Defendants Hong and Zheng in particular coveted the emails of attorneys involved in mergers and acquisitions, as they exchanged a list of partners who performed the work at one of the law firms prior to the hack at that firm., \n",
       ", In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, Hong, Zheng, and Chin used the stolen confidential information contained in emails to purchase shares in at least three public companies ahead of public announcements about entering into merger agreements.  The SEC alleges that they spent approximately $7.5 million in a one-month period buying shares in semiconductor company Altera Inc. in advance of a 2015 report that it was in talks to be acquired by Intel Corporation.  Within 12 hours of emails being extracted from one of the firms, Hong and Chin allegedly began purchasing shares of e-commerce company Borderfree so aggressively that they accounted for at least 25 percent of the company's trading volume on certain days in advance of the announcement of a 2015 deal.  Hong and Zheng also allegedly traded in advance of a 2014 merger announcement involving InterMune, a pharmaceutical company., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint charges Hong, Zheng, and Chin with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules.  The SEC seeks a final judgment ordering them to pay penalties and disgorge ill-gotten gains plus interest and permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws.  Hong's mother is named as a relief defendant in the SEC's complaint for the purpose of recovering ill-gotten gains in her accounts resulting from her son's illicit trading., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation is continuing, and is being conducted by Jennie B. Krasner, Devon Leppink Staren, and staff in the SEC's Information Technology Forensics Group with assistance from Wendy Kong.Â  The case is being supervised by Ricky Sachar and Antonia Chion and the litigation is being led by Britt Biles.Â  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for Southern District of New York, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority., \n",

       ", The preliminary injunction restrains Cody and his company, Boston Investment Partners, LLC (BIP), from violating certain antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, orders that the defendants' assets be frozen until further notice, enjoins them from exercising any authority or control over client accounts, and orders a detailed accounting of Cody's and BIP's assets., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, filed on December 12, 2016 in federal court in Massachusetts, alleges that Cody defrauded at least three of his retired clients over a twelve-year period by concealing the fact that their retirement accounts had suffered extensive losses. The SEC alleges that the clients did not know that their accounts had lost substantial value and were being rapidly depleted. Cody allegedly concealed these losses by leading the clients to believe that their investments were maintaining steady value and that the clients were living off income from their investments. By 2014, two of the retirees' accounts allegedly had essentially run out of funds. Cody allegedly continued to hide that the retirees' money was gone by making wire transfers of monthly deposits to the retirees' bank accounts from other sources and sending the clients fabricated tax forms. The SEC alleges that these deceptive acts caused Cody's clients to believe that their retirement savings were secure when, in fact, they were not., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleges that Cody violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest and penalties as well as permanent injunctive relief., \n",

       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Florida-based businessman has agreed to settle charges that he misused investor funds intended to create U.S. jobs through the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program., \n",
       ", The SEC alleges that Jason Adam Ogden, the CEO of a pair of smoothie and frozen yogurt franchises called Juiceblendz and Yoblendz, formed AJN Investments LLC to conduct an investment offering in conjunction with the EB-5 program, which provides foreign investors a path to permanent residency when their investments create at least 10 jobs for American workers. Investors were allegedly told that their money would help build and operate Juiceblendz and Yoblendz stores in strip malls and create a sufficient amount of jobs for them to qualify for an EB-5 visa and ultimately a green card., \n",
       ", But according to the SEC's complaint, Ogden changed his business model midstream without updating the offering materials, focusing on developing kiosks in sports arenas and university campuses rather than following through with the construction of full-size stores. Not only did this result in smaller-than-promised returns for investors, but also jeopardized their EB-5 program status because kiosks don't stimulate the same job creation as full-size stores and construction projects., \n",
       ", The SEC further alleges that Ogden improperly siphoned more than $1 million in investor funds for his personal use, making undisclosed cash transfers to his bank account. Ogden allegedly used investor funds to repay a personal loan and pay for meals and entertainment., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Florida, charges Ogden and AJN Investments with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. They agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations. Ogden agreed to pay back the amount of investor funds he misused for his own personal benefit totaling $1,008,681, plus interest of $41,024 and a penalty of $160,000. The settlement is subject to court approval., \n",
       ", The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kimberly A. Cain, Jennifer R. Turner, Timothy L. Evans, and Ty S. Martinez and supervised by Jonathan P. Scott and David L. Peavler of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n",

       ", Federal Court Imposes $7.4 Million Judgment Against Massachusetts Investment Adviser Who Steered Money to Firms that Paid Him Consulting Fees, \n",
       ",  Text goes here , \n",
       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today the resolution of an enforcement action filed by the Commission on June 16, 2015 against a Massachusetts-based investment advisory firm, Interinvest Corporation, and its owner, Hans Peter Black.  The Court entered default judgments against Interinvest and Black after both failed to answer the SEC's complaint., \n",
       ", The default judgments ordered each defendant to pay, jointly and severally, $5.4 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, reflecting management fees and other payments collected from investor funds.  The Court also imposed $2 million in civil monetary penalites against Black and $1.5 million in penalties against Interinvest.  In assessing the penalty, the Court observed that the defendants' breach of fiduciary duties through the fraudulent scheme constituted \"recurrent and egregious conduct.\"  In addition, the Court's judgment enjoins Interinvest and Black from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The SEC previously had obtained a preliminary injunction against Interinvest and Black to freeze their assets and to prohibit them from continuing to exercise investment authority over client assets under management., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleged that Interinvest and Black funneled more than $17 million in client assets into four financially troubled Canadian penny stock companies in which Black had undisclosed business and financial interests.  According to the complaint, Interinvest clients lost as much as $12 million of their $17 million investment based on the trading in the penny stock companies, some of which were purportedly in the business of exploring for gold or other minerals.  Black served on the board of directors of these companies, which collectively paid approximately $1.9 million to an entity that he controlled.

The complaint also alleges that Francisco and PDC Capital aided and abetted the other defendants' violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b), and that Francisco is also liable under section 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as a control person of the entity defendants.

       ", The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three Chinese traders with fraudulently trading on hacked nonpublic market moving information stolen from two prominent New York-based law firms, racking up almost $3 million in illegal profits.  The SEC is also seeking an asset freeze that prevents the traders from cashing in on their illicit gains.  Today's action marks the first time the SEC has charged hacking into a law firm's computer network., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleges that Iat Hong, Bo Zheng, and Hung Chin executed a deceptive scheme to hack into the networks of two law firms and steal confidential information pertaining to firm clients that were considering mergers or acquisitions., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, the alleged hacking incidents involved installing malware on the law firms' networks, compromising accounts that enabled access to all email accounts at the firms, and copying and transmitting dozens of gigabytes of emails to remote internet locations.  Defendants Hong and Zheng in particular coveted the emails of attorneys involved in mergers and acquisitions, as they exchanged a list of partners who performed the work at one of the law firms prior to the hack at that firm., \n",
       ", In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges., \n",
       ", According to the SEC's complaint, Hong, Zheng, and Chin used the stolen confidential information contained in emails to purchase shares in at least three public companies ahead of public announcements about entering into merger agreements.  The SEC alleges that they spent approximately $7.5 million in a one-month period buying shares in semiconductor company Altera Inc. in advance of a 2015 report that it was in talks to be acquired by Intel Corporation.  Within 12 hours of emails being extracted from one of the firms, Hong and Chin allegedly began purchasing shares of e-commerce company Borderfree so aggressively that they accounted for at least 25 percent of the company's trading volume on certain days in advance of the announcement of a 2015 deal.  Hong and Zheng also allegedly traded in advance of a 2014 merger announcement involving InterMune, a pharmaceutical company., \n",

The SEC seeks a final judgment ordering them to pay penalties and disgorge ill-gotten gains plus interest and permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws.

       ", The SEC's complaint, filed on December 12, 2016 in federal court in Massachusetts, alleges that Cody defrauded at least three of his retired clients over a twelve-year period by concealing the fact that their retirement accounts had suffered extensive losses. The SEC alleges that the clients did not know that their accounts had lost substantial value and were being rapidly depleted. Cody allegedly concealed these losses by leading the clients to believe that their investments were maintaining steady value and that the clients were living off income from their investments. By 2014, two of the retirees' accounts allegedly had essentially run out of funds. Cody allegedly continued to hide that the retirees' money was gone by making wire transfers of monthly deposits to the retirees' bank accounts from other sources and sending the clients fabricated tax forms. The SEC alleges that these deceptive acts caused Cody's clients to believe that their retirement savings were secure when, in fact, they were not., \n",
       ", The SEC's complaint alleges that Cody violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest and penalties as well as permanent injunctive relief., \n",
